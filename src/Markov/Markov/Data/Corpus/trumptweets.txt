1020432499082702849 The NFL National Anthem Debate is alive and well again - can't believe it! Isn't it in contract that players must stand at attention, hand on heart? The $40,000,000 Commissioner must now make a stand. First time kneeling, out for game. Second time kneeling, out for season/no pay!
1020425741664751616 I got severely criticized by the Fake News Media for being too nice to President Putin. In the Old Days they would call it Diplomacy. If I was loud & vicious, I would have been criticized for being too tough. Remember when they said I was too tough with Chairman Kim? Hypocrites!
1020316352140185600 So important. Should have been done years ago!
1020293430398935040 Farmers have been on a downward trend for 15 years. The price of soybeans has fallen 50% since 5 years before the Election. A big reason is bad (terrible) Trade Deals with other countries. They put on massive Tariffs and Barriers. Canada charges 275% on Dairy. Farmers will WIN!
1020290163933630464 ....The United States should not be penalized because we are doing so well. Tightening now hurts all that we have done. The U.S. should be allowed to recapture what was lost due to illegal currency manipulation and BAD Trade Deals. Debt coming due & we are raising rates - Really?
1020287981020729344 China, the European Union and others have been manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower, while the U.S. is raising rates while the dollars gets stronger and stronger with each passing day - taking away our big competitive edge. As usual, not a level playing field...
1020285014616002560 My deepest sympathies to the families and friends of those involved in the terrible boat accident which just took place in Missouri. Such a tragedy, such a great loss. May God be with you all!
1020008975922810883 Will the Dems and Fake News ever learn? This is classic!
1019938748413435910 Trump recognized Russian Meddling MANY TIMES
1019937445356474368 ....proliferation, cyber attacks, trade, Ukraine, Middle East peace, North Korea and more. There are many answers, some easy and some hard, to these problems...but they can ALL be solved!
1019936658240794625 Trump recognized Russian Meddling MANY TIMES.
1019936133147516929 The Summit with Russia was a great success, except with the real enemy of the people, the Fake News Media. I look forward to our second meeting so that we can start implementing some of the many things discussed, including stopping terrorism, security for Israel, nuclear........
1019932691339399168 I told you so! The European Union just slapped a Five Billion Dollar fine on one of our great companies, Google. They truly have taken advantage of the U.S., but not for long!
1019909066456489986 Really big jobs meeting today at the White House! 3 P.M.
1019903123312308224 Trump recognized Russian Meddling MANY TIMES. Thank you to @foxandfriends and @FoxNews for actually showing the clips. The Fake News wants no part of that narrative! Too bad they don't want to focus on all of the ECONOMIC and JOBS records being set.
1019899507910283264 The Fake News Media wants so badly to see a major confrontation with Russia, even a confrontation that could lead to war. They are pushing so recklessly hard and hate the fact that I'll probably have a good relationship with Putin. We are doing MUCH better than any other country!
1019894101116948480 The Fake News Media is going Crazy! They make up stories without any backup, sources or proof. Many of the stories written about me, and the good people surrounding me, are total fiction. Problem is, when you complain you just give them more publicity. But I'll complain anyway!
1019891915402203139 The Democrats have a death wish, in more ways than one - they actually want to abolish ICE. This should cost them heavily in the Midterms. Yesterday, the Republicans overwhelmingly passed a bill supporting ICE!
1019890400029499393 Thank you to Novartis for not increasing your prices on prescription drugs. Likewise to Pfizer. We are making a big push to actually reduce the prices, maybe substantially, on prescription drugs.
1019757603570806785 A total disgrace that Turkey will not release a respected U.S. Pastor, Andrew Brunson, from prison. He has been held hostage far too long. @RT_Erdogan should do something to free this wonderful Christian husband & father. He has done nothing wrong, and his family needs him!
1019695889626083331 The two biggest opponents of ICE in America today are the Democratic Party and MS-13!
1019695583853010944 Thank you to Congressman Kevin Yoder! He secured $5 BILLION for Border Security. Now we need Congress to support. Kevin has been strong on Crime, the Border, the 2nd Amendment, and he loves our Military and Vets. @RepKevinYoder has my full and total endorsement!
1019664477162278918 Brian Kemp is running for Governor of the great state of Georgia. The Primary is on Tuesday. Brian is tough on crime, strong on the border and illegal immigration. He loves our Military and our Vets and protects our Second Amendment. I give him my full and total endorsement.
1019545713435467776 3.4 million jobs created since our great Election Victory - far greater than ever anticipated, and only getting better as new and greatly improved Trade Deals start coming to fruition!
1019544304853966853 Some people HATE the fact that I got along well with President Putin of Russia. They would rather go to war than see this. It's called Trump Derangement Syndrome!
1019538038651871233 A lot of Democrats wished they voted for the Tax Cuts because the economy is booming - we could have 4% growth now and the Fed said yesterday that unemployment could drop again. @foxandfriends @kilmeade
1019533312052858880 Congratulations to Martha Roby of The Great State of Alabama on her big GOP Primary win for Congress. My endorsement came appropriately late, but when it came the flood gates opened and you had the kind of landslide victory that you deserve. Enjoy!
1019526399542091776 ....Russia has agreed to help with North Korea, where relationships with us are very good and the process is moving along. There is no rush, the sanctions remain! Big benefits and exciting future for North Korea at end of process!
1019524328927453184 While the NATO meeting in Brussels was an acknowledged triumph, with billions of dollars more being put up by member countries at a faster pace, the meeting with Russia may prove to be, in the long run, an even greater success. Many positive things will come out of that meeting..
1019520574371123200 So many people at the higher ends of intelligence loved my press conference performance in Helsinki. Putin and I discussed many important subjects at our earlier meeting. We got along well which truly bothered many haters who wanted to see a boxing match. Big results will come!
1019434161889796097 Prosperity is returning. Donald Trump is doing exactly what he said he would do as a candidate, now as the most effective president, the most successful president, in modern American history. Thank you to the great Lou Dobbs!
1019378119671730176 The Democrats want to abolish ICE, which will mean more crime in our country. I want to give ICE a big cheer! Vote Republican in November.
1019376680572456960 The meeting between President Putin and myself was a great success, except in the Fake News Media!
1019230023897833479 The economy of the United States is stronger than ever before!
1019228676460773377 Thank you @RandPaul. The President has gone through a year and a half of totally partisan investigations - what's he supposed to think?
1019225830298456066 While I had a great meeting with NATO, raising vast amounts of money, I had an even better meeting with Vladimir Putin of Russia. Sadly, it is not being reported that way - the Fake News is going Crazy!
1019218575691837443 I had a great meeting with NATO. They have paid $33 Billion more and will pay hundreds of Billions of Dollars more in the future, only because of me. NATO was weak, but now it is strong again (bad for Russia). The media only says I was rude to leaders, never mentions the money!
1019204976441221120 Thank you @RandPaul, you really get it! The President has gone through a year and a half of totally partisan investigations - what's he supposed think?
1018992115810910208 Will be interviewed on @seanhannity tonight at 9pmE and @TuckerCarlson tomorrow night at 8pmE. Enjoy!
1018956970143858688 A productive dialogue is not only good for the United States and good for Russia, but it is good for the world. #HELSINKI2018
1018955906690584576 I would rather take a political risk in pursuit of peace, than to risk peace in pursuit of politics. #HELSINKI2018
1018943446583668736 As I said today and many times before, I have GREAT confidence in MY intelligence people. However, I also recognize that in order to build a brighter future, we cannot exclusively focus on the past Ã¢ as the world's two largest nuclear powers, we must get along! #HELSINKI2018
1018900904735531014 Thank you Helsinki, Finland!
1018890862653157381 Joint Press Conference from Helsinki, Finland:
1018781525309943808 It was an honor to join you this morning. Thank you!
1018738368753078273 Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!
1018731223890481153 President Obama thought that Crooked Hillary was going to win the election, so when he was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling, he said it couldn't happen, was no big deal, & did NOTHING about it. When I won it became a big deal and the Rigged Witch Hunt headed by Strzok!
1018727890345693184 Received many calls from leaders of NATO countries thanking me for helping to bring them together and to get them focused on financial obligations, both present & future. We had a truly great Summit that was inaccurately covered by much of the media. NATO is now strong & rich!
1018541464416997376 Congratulations to France, who played extraordinary soccer, on winning the 2018 World Cup. Additionally, congratulations to President Putin and Russia for putting on a truly great World Cup Tournament -- one of the best ever!
1018530179549822977 ...know how to do is resist and obstruct! This is why there is such hatred and dissension in our country Ã¢ but at some point, it will heal!
1018530173006692352 ...over the years, I would return to criticism that it wasn't good enough Ã¢ that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition! Much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people and all the Dems...
1018530167902228480 Heading to Helsinki, Finland Ã¢ looking forward to meeting with President Putin tomorrow. Unfortunately, no matter how well I do at the Summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia...
1018528420093878272 There hasn't been a missile or rocket fired in 9 months in North Korea, there have been no nuclear tests and we got back our hostages. Who knows how it will all turn out in the end, but why isn't the Fake News talking about these wonderful facts? Because it is FAKE NEWS!
1018197842559725569 These Russian individuals did their work during the Obama years. Why didn't Obama do something about it? Because he thought Crooked Hillary Clinton would win, that's why. Had nothing to do with the Trump Administration, but Fake News doesn't want to report the truth, as usual!
1018113905716027393 Our prayers are with those affected by the flooding in Japan. We commend the rescue efforts and offer condolences to all who were injured or lost loved ones.
1018096402520518656 ....Remember, it was Little Jeff Z and his people, who are told exactly what to say, who said I could not win the election in that there was no way to 270 (over & over again) in the Electoral College. I got 306! They were sooooo wrong in their election coverage. Still hurting!
1018093807060045824 So funny! I just checked out Fake News CNN, for the first time in a long time (they are dying in the ratings), to see if they covered my takedown yesterday of Jim Acosta (actually a nice guy). They didn't! But they did say I already lost in my meeting with Putin. Fake News......
1018074723140427776 The stories you heard about the 12 Russians yesterday took place during the Obama Administration, not the Trump Administration. Why didn't they do something about it, especially when it was reported that President Obama was informed by the FBI in September, before the Election?
1018072081676865536 ....Where is the DNC Server, and why didn't the FBI take possession of it? Deep State?
1018070907741523968 The stories you heard about the 12 Russians yesterday took place during the Obama Administration, not the Trump Administrations. Why didn't they do something about it, especially when it was reported that President Obama was informed by the FBI in September, before the Election?
1018069319702458368 The Stock Market hit 25,000 yesterday. Jobs are at an all time record - and that is before we fix some of the worst trade deals and conditions ever seen by any government. It is all happening!
1018068353305411584 I have arrived in Scotland and will be at Trump Turnberry for two days of meetings, calls and hopefully, some golf - my primary form of exercise! The weather is beautiful, and this place is incredible! Tomorrow I go to Helsinki for a Monday meeting with Vladimir Putin.
1018062211909083136 This is now changing - for the first time!
1017772506470649857 Joint Press Conference with Prime Minister Theresa May...
1017650505043140609 Congressman Matt Gaetz of Florida is one of the finest and most talented people in Congress. Strong on Crime, the Border, Illegal Immigration, the 2nd Amendment, our great Military & Vets, Matt worked tirelessly on helping to get our Massive Tax Cuts. He has my Full Endorsement!
1017466758280679425 Great success today at NATO! Billions of additional dollars paid by members since my election. Great spirit!
1017446575474335744 A very nice note from Chairman Kim of North Korea. Great progress being made!
1017426065029910529 Trump has been the most consequential president in history when it comes to minority employment. In June, for instance, the unemployment rate for Hispanics and Latinos 16 years and older fell to 4.6%, its lowest level ever, from 4.9% in May.
1017362207426908160 #NATOSummit2018 Press Conference in Brussels, Belgium:
1017290478839050240 ....On top of it all, Germany just started paying Russia, the country they want protection from, Billions of Dollars for their Energy needs coming out of a new pipeline from Russia. Not acceptable! All NATO Nations must meet their 2% commitment, and that must ultimately go to 4%!
1017288317342224384 Presidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get Germany and other rich NATO Nations to pay more toward their protection from Russia. They pay only a fraction of their cost. The U.S. pays tens of Billions of Dollars too much to subsidize Europe, and loses Big on Trade!
1017286281867481089 As I head out to a very important NATO meeting, I see that FBI Lover/Agent Lisa Page is dodging a Subpoena & is refusing to show up and testify. What can she possibly say about her statements and lies. So much corruption on the other side. Where is the Attorney General? @FoxNews
1017190186269184001 Billions of additional dollars are being spent by NATO countries since my visit last year, at my request, but it isn't nearly enough. U.S. spends too much. Europe's borders are BAD! Pipeline dollars to Russia are not acceptable!
1017178539706212353 How can the Rigged Witch Hunt proceed when it was started, influenced and worked on, for an extended period of time, by former FBI Agent/Lover Peter Strzok? Read his hate filled and totally biased Emails and the answer is clear!
1017164990099415041 Ex-FBI LAYER Lisa Page today defied a House of Representatives issued Subpoena to testify before Congress! Wow, but is anybody really surprised! Together with her lover, FBI Agent Peter Strzok, she worked on the Rigged Witch Hunt, perhaps the most tainted and corrupt case EVER!
1017153813625626624 If the Democrats want to win Supreme Court and other Court picks, don't Obstruct and Resist, but rather do it the good ol' fashioned way, WIN ELECTIONS!
1017093020783710209 What good is NATO if Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars for gas and energy? Why are there only 5 out of 29 countries that have met their commitment? The U.S. is paying for Europe's protection, then loses billions on Trade. Must pay 2% of GDP IMMEDIATELY, not by 2025.
1017088833890942981 What good is NATO if Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars for gas and energy? Why are their only 5 out of 29 countries that have met their commitment? The U.S. is paying for Europe's protection, then loses billions on Trade. Must pay 2% of GDP IMMEDIATELY, not by 2025.
1017086416176730112 Democrats in Congress must no longer Obstruct - vote to fix our terrible Immigration Laws now. I am watching what is going on from Europe - it would be soooo simple to fix. Judges run the system and illegals and traffickers know how it works. They are just using children!
1017025848409550848 ...things up, better than ever before, but it can't go too quickly. I am fighting for a level playing field for our farmers, and will win!
1017025845905494016 I am in Brussels, but always thinking about our farmers. Soy beans fell 50% from 2012 to my election. Farmers have done poorly for 15 years. Other countries' trade barriers and tariffs have been destroying their businesses. I will open...
1016956445307400193 Bilateral Breakfast with NATO Secretary General in Brussels, Belgium...
1016813686051233800 Just talked with Pfizer CEO and @SecAzar on our drug pricing blueprint. Pfizer is rolling back price hikes, so American patients don't pay more. We applaud Pfizer for this decision and hope other companies do the same. Great news for the American people!
1016757033071079424 The European Union makes it impossible for our farmers and workers and companies to do business in Europe (U.S. has a $151 Billion trade deficit), and then they want us to happily defend them through NATO, and nicely pay for it. Just doesn't work!
1016754517415624704 A recent Emerson College ePoll said that most Americans, especially Hispanics, feel that they are better off under President Trump than they were under President Obama.
1016729137409486853 Many countries in NATO, which we are expected to defend, are not only short of their current commitment of 2% (which is low), but are also delinquent for many years in payments that have not been made. Will they reimburse the U.S.?
1016695860267134976 Informing the Republican Senators of my nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh. #SCOTUS
1016693575344504832 I am on Air Force One flying to NATO and hear reports that the FBI lovers, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page are getting cold feet on testifying about the Rigged Witch Hunt headed by 13 Angry Democrats and people that worked for Obama for 8 years. Total disgrace!
1016663151935291393 On behalf of the United States, congratulations to the Thai Navy SEALs and all on the successful rescue of the 12 boys and their coach from the treacherous cave in Thailand. Such a beautiful moment - all freed, great job!
1016638035281219584 Thank you to all of my great supporters, really big progress being made. Other countries wanting to fix crazy trade deals. Economy is ROARING. Supreme Court pick getting GREAT REVIEWS. New Poll says Trump, at over 90%, is the most popular Republican in history of the Party. Wow!
1016633811378073602 NATO countries must pay MORE, the United States must pay LESS. Very Unfair!
1016616792926703616 Getting ready to leave for Europe. First meeting - NATO. The U.S. is spending many times more than any other country in order to protect them. Not fair to the U.S. taxpayer. On top of that we lose $151 Billion on Trade with the European Union. Charge us big Tariffs (& Barriers)!
1016515895735267328 Tonight, it was my honor and privilege to nominate Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court. #SCOTUS
1016447571563249666 HAPPY 100TH BIRTHDAY to our amazing current and former Army Warrant Officers. Thank you for your century of service, as the indispensable guardians of our great @USArmy's technology! #CenturyOfService
1016368503723577344 Pfizer & others should be ashamed that they have raised drug prices for no reason. They are merely taking advantage of the poor & others unable to defend themselves, while at the same time giving bargain basement prices to other countries in Europe & elsewhere. We will respond!
1016367395294908421 The failing NY Times Fake News story today about breast feeding must be called out. The U.S. strongly supports breast feeding but we don't believe women should be denied access to formula. Many women need this option because of malnutrition and poverty.
1016327387154395138 I have confidence that Kim Jong Un will honor the contract we signed &, even more importantly, our handshake. We agreed to the denuclearization of North Korea. China, on the other hand, may be exerting negative pressure on a deal because of our posture on Chinese Trade-Hope Not!
1016294574417956869 I have long heard that the most important decision a U.S. President can make is the selection of a Supreme Court Justice - Will be announced tonight at 9:00 P.M.
1016291887957848066 ...Europe far more than it does the U.S. By some accounts, the U.S. is paying for 90% of NATO, with many countries nowhere close to their 2% commitment. On top of this the European Union has a Trade Surplus of $151 Million with the U.S., with big Trade Barriers on U.S. goods. NO!
1016289620596789248 The United States is spending far more on NATO than any other Country. This is not fair, nor is it acceptable. While these countries have been increasing their contributions since I took office, they must do much more. Germany is at 1%, the U.S. is at 4%, and NATO benefits.......
1016079192604139520 They just didn't get it, but they do now!
1016071245568380934 Looking forward to announcing my final decision on the United States Supreme Court Justice at 9:00pmE tomorrow night at the @WhiteHouse. An exceptional person will be chosen!
1016056693791346688 Iranian Harassment of U.S. Warships:
1015947163292008451 The U.S. is working very closely with the Government of Thailand to help get all of the children out of the cave and to safety. Very brave and talented people!
1015723140364865536 The Rigged Witch Hunt, originally headed by FBI lover boy Peter S (for one year) & now, 13 Angry Democrats, should look into the missing DNC Server, Crooked Hillary's illegally deleted Emails, the Pakistani Fraudster, Uranium One, Podesta & so much more. It's a Democrat Con Job!
1015697664514674689 Public opinion has turned strongly against the Rigged Witch Hunt and the Special Counsel because the public understands that there was no Collusion with Russia (so ridiculous), that the two FBI lovers were a fraud against our Nation & that the only Collusion was with the Dems!
1015694335151656961 Public opinion has turned strongly against the Rigged Witch Hunt and the Special Councel because the public understands that there was no Collusion with Russia (so ridiculous), that the two FBI lovers were a fraud against our Nation & that the only Collusion was with the Dems!
1015587406374932480 Big decision will soon be made on our next Justice of the Supreme Court!
1015586529484443648 Twitter is getting rid of fake accounts at a record pace. Will that include the Failing New York Times and propaganda machine for Amazon, the Washington Post, who constantly quote anonymous sources that, in my opinion, don't exist - They will both be out of business in 7 years!
1015278594795417600 Just won lawsuit filed by the DNC and a bunch of Democrat crazies trying to claim the Trump Campaign (and others), colluded with Russia. They haven't figured out that this was an excuse for them losing the election!
1015039273987264517 Thanks to REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP, America is WINNING AGAIN - and America is being RESPECTED again all over the world. Because we are finally putting AMERICA FIRST!
1015037322226642944 Every day, the brave men and women of ICE are liberating communities from savage gangs like MS-13. We will NOT stand for these vile Democrat smears in law enforcement. We will always stand proudly with the BRAVE HEROES of ICE and BORDER PATROL!
1015033658548207616 A vote for Democrats in November is a vote to let MS-13 run wild in our communities, to let drugs pour into our cities, and to take jobs and benefits away from hardworking Americans. Democrats want anarchy, amnesty and chaos - Republicans want LAW, ORDER and JUSTICE!
1015025320657743872 It was my great honor to join proud, hardworking American Patriots in Montana tonight. I love you - thank you! #MAGA
1014956573095915520 ...on Monday assume duties as the acting Administrator of the EPA. I have no doubt that Andy will continue on with our great and lasting EPA agenda. We have made tremendous progress and the future of the EPA is very bright!
1014956568129892352 I have accepted the resignation of Scott Pruitt as the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Within the Agency Scott has done an outstanding job, and I will always be thankful to him for this. The Senate confirmed Deputy at EPA, Andrew Wheeler, will...
1014875894614319104 Congress - FIX OUR INSANE IMMIGRATION LAWS NOW!
1014875575557804034 .....Country being forced to endure a long and costly trial. Tell the people OUT, and they must leave, just as they would if they were standing on your front lawn. Hiring thousands of judges does not work and is not acceptable - only Country in the World that does this!
1014873774003556354 Congress must pass smart, fast and reasonable Immigration Laws now. Law Enforcement at the Border is doing a great job, but the laws they are forced to work with are insane. When people, with or without children, enter our Country, they must be told to leave without our........
1014611307427966976 The OPEC Monopoly must remember that gas prices are up & they are doing little to help. If anything, they are driving prices higher as the United States defends many of their members for very little $'s. This must be a two way street. REDUCE PRICING NOW!
1014519862482407424 Happy Fourth of July....Our Country is doing GREAT!
1014306963243532296 Tomorrow, families across our Nation will gather to celebrate the Fourth of July. As we do, we will think of the men & women serving overseas at this very moment, far away from their families, protecting America - & we will thank GOD for blessing us with these incredible HEROES!
1014295759393644545 ...has endured because of the sweat, blood and sacrifice of the American Armed Forces Ã¢ the greatest force for peace and justice in the history of the world!
1014295751814533120 Tonight we gathered to celebrate the courageous men and women who make freedom possible: our brave service members, and our wonderful Veterans. For 242 years, American Independence...
1014287566386888709 Thank you, @WVGovernor Jim Justice, for that warm introduction. Tonight, it was my great honor to attend the Greenbrier Classic Ã¢ Salute to Service Dinner in West Virginia! God Bless our Veterans. God Bless America - and HAPPY INDEPENDENCE DAY TO ALL!
1014286054805987330 After having written many best selling books, and somewhat priding myself on my ability to write, it should be noted that the Fake News constantly likes to pore over my tweets looking for a mistake. I capitalize certain words only for emphasis, not b/c they should be capitalized!
1014272859408162816 Just arrived in West Virginia!
1014261296240488450 The Washington Post is constantly quoting anonymous sources that do not exist. Rarely do they use the name of anyone because there is no one to give them the kind of negative quote that they are looking for. They are a disgrace to journalism but then again, so are many others!
1014258987422928896 Heading to West Virginia to be with my friend, @WVGovernor Jim Justice, at his beautiful Greenbrier Resort. He works hard, does a great job, and raises lots of money for charities!
1014257237945176071 After having written many best selling books, and somewhat priding myself on my ability to write, it should be noted that the Fake News constantly likes to pour over my tweets looking for a mistake. I capitalize certain words only for emphasis, not b/c they should be capitalized!
1014256591330250752 The Washington Post is constantly quoting anonymous sources that do not exist. Rarely do they use the name of anyone because there is no one to give them the kind of negative quote that they are looking for. They are a discgrace to journalism but then again, so are many others!
1014151457954811904 Wow! The NSA has deleted 685 million phone calls and text messages. Privacy violations? They blame technical irregularities. Such a disgrace. The Witch Hunt continues!
1014146835135516672 Now that Harley-Davidson is moving part of its operation out of the U.S., my Administration is working with other Motor Cycle companies who want to move into the U.S. Harley customers are not happy with their move - sales are down 7% in 2017. The U.S. is where the Action is!
1014117468858650624 Just out that the Obama Administration granted citizenship, during the terrible Iran Deal negotiation, to 2,500 Iranians - including to government officials. How big (and bad) is that?
1014105549624037377 Many good conversations with North Korea-it is going well! In the meantime, no Rocket Launches or Nuclear Testing in 8 months. All of Asia is thrilled. Only the Opposition Party, which includes the Fake News, is complaining. If not for me, we would now be at War with North Korea!
1014100908127543296 How can the Democrats, who are weak on the Border and weak on Crime, do well in November. The people of our Country want and demand Safety and Security, while the Democrats are more interested in ripping apart and demeaning (and not properly funding) our great Law Enforcement!
1014098721460686849 When we have an infestation of MS-13 GANGS in certain parts of our country, who do we send to get them out? ICE! They are tougher and smarter than these rough criminal elelments that bad immigration laws allow into our country. Dems do not appreciate the great job they do! Nov.
1014094834863362049 The economy is doing perhaps better than ever before, and that's prior to fixing some of the worst and most unfair Trade Deals ever made by any country. In any event, they are coming along very well. Most countries agree that they must be changed, but nobody ever asked!
1014092792329535488 I interviewed 4 very impressive people yesterday. On Monday I will be announcing my decision for Justice of the United States Supreme Court!
1014090584963866624 Crazy Maxine Waters, said by some to be one of the most corrupt people in politics, is rapidly becoming, together with Nancy Pelosi, the FACE of the Democrat Party. Her ranting and raving, even referring to herself as a wounded animal, will make people flee the Democrats!
1013976609290964997 Many Democrats are deeply concerned about the fact that their leadership wants to denounce and abandon the great men and women of ICE, thereby declaring war on Law & Order. These people will be voting for Republicans in November and, in many cases, joining the Republican Party!
1013902140409040897 Today, it was my great honor to welcome Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands, to the @WhiteHouse!
1013618640061595648 Congratulations to Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on becoming the next President of Mexico. I look very much forward to working with him. There is much to be done that will benefit both the United States and Mexico!
1013507396558303233 A big week, especially with our numerous victories in the Supreme Court. Heading back to the White House now. Focus will be on the selection of a new Supreme Court Justice. Exciting times for our country. Economy may be stronger than it has ever been!
1013394559429169152 The Liberal Left, also known as the Democrats, want to get rid of ICE, who do a fantastic job, and want Open Borders. Crime would be rampant and uncontrollable! Make America Great Again
1013391783533989888 I will be interviewed by @MariaBartiromo at 10:00 A.M. on @FoxNews
1013146187510243328 When people come into our Country illegally, we must IMMEDIATELY escort them back out without going through years of legal maneuvering. Our laws are the dumbest anywhere in the world. Republicans want Strong Borders and no Crime. Dems want Open Borders and are weak on Crime!
1013143055417905152 I will be interviewed by @MariaBartiromo on Sunday on @FoxNews at 10:00 A. M. Enjoy!
1013141673776500736 Either we need to elect more Republicans in November or Republicans must end the ridiculous 60 vote, or Filibuster, rule - or better yet, do both. Cryin' Chuck would do it on day one, but we'll never give him the chance. Some great legislation awaits - be smart!
1013139532290625538 I never pushed the Republicans in the House to vote for the Immigration Bill, either GOODLATTE 1 or 2, because it could never have gotten enough Democrats as long as there is the 60 vote threshold. I released many prior to the vote knowing we need more Republicans to win in Nov.
1013136536576188416 A friend of mine and a man who has truly seen politics and life as few others ever will, Sean Spicer, has written a great new book, The Briefing: Politics, the Press and the President. It is a story told with both heart and knowledge. Really good, go get it!
1013037916216614912 I will be making my choice for Justice of the United States Supreme Court on the first Monday after the July 4th Holiday, July 9th!
1013023608040513537 Just spoke to King Salman of Saudi Arabia and explained to him that, because of the turmoil & disfunction in Iran and Venezuela, I am asking that Saudi Arabia increase oil production, maybe up to 2,000,000 barrels, to make up the difference...Prices to high! He has agreed!
1013019990340046849 To the great and brave men and women of ICE, do not worry or lose your spirit. You are doing a fantastic job of keeping us safe by eradicating the worst criminal elements. So brave! The radical left Dems want you out. Next it will be all police. Zero chance, It will never happen!
1013016168377081856 The Democrats are making a strong push to abolish ICE, one of the smartest, toughest and most spirited law enforcement groups of men and women that I have ever seen. I have watched ICE liberate towns from the grasp of MS-13 & clean out the toughest of situations. They are great!
1012840647743737857 The new plant being built by Foxconn in Wisconsin is incredible. Congratulations to the people of Wisconsin and to Governor Scott Walker @GovWalker and his talented representatives for having pulled it off. Great job!
1012759156426670083 Six months after our TAX CUTS, more than 6 MILLION workers have received bonuses, pay raises, and retirement account contributions.
1012757431124930562 Before going any further today, I want to address the horrific shooting that took place yesterday at the Capital Gazette newsroom in Annapolis, Maryland. This attack shocked the conscience of our Nation, and filled our hearts with grief...
1012437964373123072 Prior to departing Wisconsin, I was briefed on the shooting at Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland. My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families. Thank you to all of the First Responders who are currently on the scene.
1012412743520047111 AMERICA IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS!
1012409641911930881 Today, we broke ground on a plant that will provide jobs for up to 15,000 Wisconsin Workers! As Foxconn has discovered, there is no better place to build, hire and grow than right here in the United States!
1012321218056384513 I am in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, for meetings. Soon to leave for a big groundbreaking for Foxconn, which is building a great new electronics plant in Wisconsin. 15,000 Jobs, so great!
1012318771250384896 ....persecuted on old and/or totally unrelated charges (there was no collusion and there was no obstruction of the no collusion)...And what is going on in the FBI & DOJ with Crooked Hillary, the DNC and all of the lies? A disgraceful situation!
1012315534220808192 When is Bob Mueller going to list his Conflicts of Interest? Why has it taken so long? Will they be listed at the top of his $22,000,000 Report...And what about the 13 Angry Democrats, will they list their conflicts with Crooked H? How many people will be sent to jail and......
1012312287280074754 Peter Strzok worked as the leader of the Rigged Witch Hunt for a long period of time - he got it started and was only fired because the gig was up. But remember, he took his orders from Comey and McCabe and they took their orders from you know who. Mueller/Comey best friends!
1012299239207198721 Just watched @SharkGregNorman on @foxandfriends. Said President is doing a great job. All over the world, people want to come back to the U.S. Thank you Greg, and you're looking and doing great!
1012297599431401474 Amy Kremer, Women for Trump, was so great on @foxandfriends. Brave and very smart, thank you Amy! @AmyKremer
1012295859072126977 Russia continues to say they had nothing to do with Meddling in our Election! Where is the DNC Server, and why didn't Shady James Comey and the now disgraced FBI agents take and closely examine it? Why isn't Hillary/Russia being looked at? So many questions, so much corruption!
1012290012279435265 Lover FBI Agent Peter Strzok was given poor marks on yesterday's closed door testimony and, according to most reports, refused to answer many questions. There was no Collusion and the Witch Hunt, headed by 13 Angry Democrats and others who are totally conflicted, is Rigged!
1012174975061647360 In recent days we have heard shameless attacks on our courageous law enforcement officers. Extremist Democrat politicians have called for the complete elimination of ICE. Leftwing Activists are trying to block ICE officers from doing their jobs and publicly posting their...
1012174976668061699 ...home addresses Ã¢ putting these selfless public servants in harm's way. These radical protesters want ANARCHY Ã¢ but the only response they will find from our government is LAW AND ORDER!
1012169482272460800 Thank you North Dakota. Together, we are MAKING AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN! #MAGA
1012112077781995521 Just landed in North Dakota with @SenJohnHoeven and @RepKevinCramer. We will see everyone at Scheels Arena shortly!
1012082654370336768 Today, it was my great honor to welcome President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa of Portugal to the @WhiteHouse!Ã°Å¸ÂºÃ°Å¸Â¸Ã°Å¸Ã°Å¸Â¹
1012070304091435010 Heading to North Dakota to fully stand with and endorse Kevin Cramer for Senate. He is an extraordinary Congressman who will hopefully soon represent this great state as your Senator. He is tough on crime, strong on borders, loves our Military, and our Vets! #NDSen
1012051330591023107 Statement on Justice Anthony Kennedy. #SCOTUS
1012026033418076160 Today, I was thrilled to join student leaders from Colleges and Universities across the country...
1011994162076573697 Harley-Davidson should stay 100% in America, with the people that got you your success. I've done so much for you, and then this. Other companies are coming back where they belong! We won't forget, and neither will your customers or your now very HAPPY competitors!
1011975204778729474 Supreme Court rules in favor of non-union workers who are now, as an example, able to support a candidate of his or her choice without having those who control the Union deciding for them. Big loss for the coffers of the Democrats!
1011952266268545024 HOUSE REPUBLICANS SHOULD PASS THE STRONG BUT FAIR IMMIGRATION BILL, KNOWN AS GOODLATTE II, IN THEIR AFTERNOON VOTE TODAY, EVEN THOUGH THE DEMS WON'T LET IT PASS IN THE SENATE. PASSAGE WILL SHOW THAT WE WANT STRONG BORDERS & SECURITY WHILE THE DEMS WANT OPEN BORDERS = CRIME. WIN!
1011931656230526976 Congratulations to Maxine Waters, whose crazy rants have made her, together with Nancy Pelosi, the unhinged FACE of the Democrat Party. Together, they will Make America Weak Again! But have no fear, America is now stronger than ever before, and I'm not going anywhere!
1011819474574561283 Big and conclusive win by Mitt Romney. Congratulations! I look forward to working together - there is so much good to do. A great and loving family will be coming to D.C.
1011806195462688768 The legendary Gary Player at Turnberry in Scotland!
1011805006390071304 A great First Lady!
1011803149911384064 The Democrats are in Turmoil! Open Borders and unchecked Crime a certain way to lose elections. Republicans are for Strong Borders, NO Crime! A BIG NIGHT!
1011795883925663744 Wow! Big Trump Hater Congressman Joe Crowley, who many expected was going to take Nancy Pelosi's place, just LOST his primary election. In other words, he's out! That is a big one that nobody saw happening. Perhaps he should have been nicer, and more respectful, to his President!
1011792563425116161 Tremendous win for Congressman Dan Donovan. You showed great courage in a tough race! New York, and my many friends on Staten Island, have elected someone they have always been very proud of. Congratulations!
1011789419521675264 Congratulations to Governor Henry McMaster on your BIG election win! South Carolina loves you. We are all proud of you and Peggy! @henrymcmaster
1011703668721246209 Today, we tell the story of an incredible HERO who defended our nation in World War Two Ã¢ First Lieutenant Garlin Murl Conner. Although he died 20 years ago, today he takes his rightful place in the Eternal Chronicle of American Valor...
1011620271327989760 SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS TRUMP TRAVEL BAN. Wow!
1011602664143106048 The most profound question of our era: Was there a conspiracy in the Obama Department of Justice and the FBI to prevent Donald Trump from becoming President of the U.S., and was Strzok at the core of the conspiracy? Judge Andrew Napolitano
1011588967442022406 The face of the Democrats is now Maxine Waters who, together with Nancy Pelosi, have established a fine leadership team. They should always stay together and lead the Democrats, who want Open Borders and Unlimited Crime, well into the future....and pick Crooked Hillary for Pres.
1011584315040419840 A Harley-Davidson should never be built in another country-never! Their employees and customers are already very angry at them. If they move, watch, it will be the beginning of the end - they surrendered, they quit! The Aura will be gone and they will be taxed like never before!
1011579076493144065 It was great being with Governor Henry McMaster last night in South Carolina. Henry is tough on Crime and Borders, loves our Military and our Vets and has created many jobs and a great economy. GO OUT AND VOTE FOR HENRY TODAY, HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!
1011577303023980544 ....We are finishing our study of Tariffs on cars from the E.U. in that they have long taken advantage of the U.S. in the form of Trade Barriers and Tariffs. In the end it will all even out - and it won't take very long!
1011574256117993472 ....When I had Harley-Davidson officials over to the White House, I chided them about tariffs in other countries, like India, being too high. Companies are now coming back to America. Harley must know that they won't be able to sell back into U.S. without paying a big tax!
1011571026034089984 ....We are getting other countries to reduce and eliminate tariffs and trade barriers that have been unfairly used for years against our farmers, workers and companies. We are opening up closed markets and expanding our footprint. They must play fair or they will pay tariffs!
1011568906992017408 Early this year Harley-Davidson said they would move much of their plant operations in Kansas City to Thailand. That was long before Tariffs were announced. Hence, they were just using Tariffs/Trade War as an excuse. Shows how unbalanced & unfair trade is, but we will fix it.....
1011422555947712513 Thank you South Carolina. Now let's get out tomorrow and VOTE for @HenryMcMaster!
1011394762979586049 Just landed in South Carolina - will be at the McMaster rally shortly! #MAGA
1011391230188457984 The hearing of Peter Strzok and the other hating frauds at the FBI & DOJ should be shown to the public on live television, not a closed door hearing that nobody will see. We should expose these people for what they are - there should be total transparency!
1011389124475961345 Why is Senator Mark Warner (D-VA), perhaps in a near drunken state, claiming he has information that only he and Bob Mueller, the leader of the 13 Angry Democrats on a Witch Hunt, knows? Isn't this highly illegal. Is it being investigated?
1011385283562967041 Director David Lynch: Trump Could Go Down as One of the Greatest Presidents
1011360410648416258 Surprised that Harley-Davidson, of all companies, would be the first to wave the White Flag. I fought hard for them and ultimately they will not pay tariffs selling into the E.U., which has hurt us badly on trade, down $151 Billion. Taxes just a Harley excuse - be patient! #MAGA
1011295779422695424 Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party. She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max!
1011256862975676416 Will be heading to one of my favorite places, South Carolina, to fight for one of my original fighters, Governor Henry McMaster. Speaking at 7:00 P.M.
1011231137233080321 ....If this is done, illegal immigration will be stopped in it's tracks - and at very little, by comparison, cost. This is the only real answer - and we must continue to BUILD THE WALL!
1011228265003077632 Hiring manythousands of judges, and going through a long and complicated legal process, is not the way to go - will always be disfunctional. People must simply be stopped at the Border and told they cannot come into the U.S. illegally. Children brought back to their country......
1011226622324887556 Such a difference in the media coverage of the same immigration policies between the Obama Administration and ours. Actually, we have done a far better job in that our facilities are cleaner and better run than were the facilities under Obama. Fake News is working overtime!
1011218033216512005 I have tried to stay uninvolved with the Department of Justice and FBI (although I do not legally have to), because of the now totally discredited and very expensive Witch Hunt currently going on. But you do have to ask why the DOJ & FBI aren't giving over requested documents?
1011212766487728133 The Red Hen Restaurant should focus more on cleaning its filthy canopies, doors and windows (badly needs a paint job) rather than refusing to serve a fine person like Sarah Huckabee Sanders. I always had a rule, if a restaurant is dirty on the outside, it is dirty on the inside!
1011209592670425088 Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey said that President Trump is probably correct that there was surveillance on Trump Tower. Actually, far greater than would ever have been believed!
1011053439575576576 @RepClayHiggins has been a great help to me on Cutting Taxes, creating great new healthcare programs at low cost, fighting for Border Security, our Military and are Vets. He is tough on Crime and has my full Endorsement. The Great State of Louisiana, we want Clay!
1011038477889175553 House Republicans could easily pass a Bill on Strong Border Security but remember, it still has to pass in the Senate, and for that we need 10 Democrat votes, and all they do is RESIST. They want Open Borders and don't care about Crime! Need more Republicans to WIN in November!
1011036523964268544 @ClayHiggins18 has been a great help to me on Cutting Taxes, creating great new healthcare programs at low cost, fighting for Border Security, our Military and are Vets. He is tough on Crime and has my full Endorsement. The Great State of Louisiana, we want Clay!
1011036519812030467 @jimmyfallon is now whimpering to all that he did the famous hair show with me (where he seriously messed up my hair), & that he would have now done it differently because it is said to have humanized me-he is taking heat. He called & said monster ratings. Be a man Jimmy!
1010978975391322112 The United States is insisting that all countries that have placed artificial Trade Barriers and Tariffs on goods going into their country, remove those Barriers & Tariffs or be met with more than Reciprocity by the U.S.A. Trade must be fair and no longer a one way street!
1010902506422046721 ....Our Immigration policy, laughed at all over the world, is very unfair to all of those people who have gone through the system legally and are waiting on line for years! Immigration must be based on merit - we need people who will help to Make America Great Again!
1010900865602019329 We cannot allow all of these people to invade our Country. When somebody comes in, we must immediately, with no Judges or Court Cases, bring them back from where they came. Our system is a mockery to good immigration policy and Law and Order. Most children come without parents...
1010873383087636480 Democrats, fix the laws. Don't RESIST. We are doing a far better job than Bush and Obama, but we need strength and security at the Border! Cannot accept all of the people trying to break into our Country. Strong Borders, No Crime!
1010699954157830144 Major Wall Street Journal opinion piece today talking about the Russian Witch Hunt and the disgrace that it is. So many people hurt, so bad for our country - a total sham!
1010645413576126464 AMERICA IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS!
1010619779600642048 Thank you @NVGOP! #MAGA
1010571197271011328 Happy Birthday to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, a friend and great man!
1010569562138406912 It's very sad that Nancy Pelosi and her sidekick, Cryin' Chuck Schumer, want to protect illegal immigrants far more than the citizens of our country. The United States cannot stand for this. We wants safety and security at our borders!
1010567610352611328 Heading to Nevada to talk trade and immigration with supporters. Country's economy is stronger than ever before with numbers that are getting better by the week. Tremendous potential, and trade deals are coming along well.
1010536329766006784 My thoughts and prayers are with Representative Katie Arrington of South Carolina, including all of those involved in last nights car accident, and their families.
1010522945402224642 ...everyone how much he likes me, but he will only vote with Nancy Pelosi. Keith is strong on borders and tough on crime Ã¢ and loves cutting taxes! #MAGA
1010522933498806278 @VP Pence is heading to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where we have both strongly endorsed one of the finest men around, Congressman Keith @RothfusForPA. He is running against #LambTheSham, who is telling...
1010505990259855361 Drudge Report OBAMA KEPT THEM IN CAGES, WRAPPED THEM IN FOIL We do a much better job while at the same time maintaining a MUCH stronger Border! Mainstream Fake Media hates this story.
1010503423773507584 Disability applications plunge as economy strengthens Failing New York Times
1010502249263624195 The National Association of Manufacturers just announced that 95.1% of Manufacturers have a positive outlook for their companies. This is the best number in the Association's history!
1010486772541816834 The Russian Witch Hunt is Rigged!
1010485876806348800 @FoxNews Poll numbers plummet on the Democrat inspired and paid for Russian Witch Hunt. With all of the bias, lying and hate by the investigators, people want the investigators investigated. Much more will come out. A total scam and excuse for the Dems losing the Election!
1010481479279923201 Steel is coming back fast! U.S. Steel is adding great capacity also. So are others.
1010320166486454272 Based on the Tariffs and Trade Barriers long placed on the U.S. & its great companies and workers by the European Union, if these Tariffs and Barriers are not soon broken down and removed, we will be placing a 20% Tariff on all of their cars coming into the U.S. Build them here!
1010257002478620673 Our first duty, and our highest loyalty, is to the citizens of the United States. We will not rest until our border is secure, our citizens are safe, and we finally end the immigration crisis once and for all.
1010246126820347906 We are gathered today to hear directly from the AMERICAN VICTIMS of ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. These are the American Citizens permanently separated from their loved ones b/c they were killed by criminal illegal aliens. These are the families the media ignores...
1010166772912320513 Based on the Tariffs and Trade Barriers long placed on the U.S. and it great companies and workers by the European Union, if these Tariffs and Barriers are not soon broken down and removed, we will be placing a 20% Tariff on all of their cars coming into the U.S. Build them here!
1010163024173457409 Hope OPEC will increase output substantially. Need to keep prices down!
1010156224749408258 We must maintain a Strong Southern Border. We cannot allow our Country to be overrun by illegal immigrants as the Democrats tell their phony stories of sadness and grief, hoping it will help them in the elections. Obama and others had the same pictures, and did nothing about it!
1010153153084428288 80% of Mexico's Exports come to the United States. They totally rely on us, which is fine with me. They do have, though, very strong Immigration Laws. The U.S. has pathetically weak and ineffective Immigration Laws that the Democrats refuse to help us fix. Will speak to Mexico!
1010129956222001153 Congressman Ron DeSantis, a top student at Yale and Harvard Law School, is running for Governor of the Great State of Florida. Ron is strong on Borders, tough on Crime & big on Cutting Taxes - Loves our Military & our Vets. He will be a Great Governor & has my full Endorsement!
1010126805850902528 Congresswoman Martha Roby of Alabama has been a consistent and reliable vote for our Make America Great Again Agenda. She is in a Republican Primary run-off against a recent Nancy Pelosi voting Democrat. I fully endorse Martha for Alabama 2nd Congressional District!
1010123101684883457 Governor Henry McMaster is a truly fine man who loves the People of South Carolina. He was one of my very early supporters and truly helped me to a Big South Carolina Victory. I will see you all in S.C on Monday and Vice President Pence will be there for Henry on Saturday!
1010116816998490113 Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November. Dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem. We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave!
1010115331380203520 Elect more Republicans in November and we will pass the finest, fairest and most comprehensive Immigration Bills anywhere in the world. Right now we have the dumbest and the worst. Dems are doing nothing but Obstructing. Remember their motto, RESIST! Ours is PRODUCE!
1010113882344558592 Even if we get 100% Republican votes in the Senate, we need 10 Democrat votes to get a much needed Immigration Bill - & the Dems are Obstructionists who won't give votes for political reasons & because they don't care about Crime coming from Border! So we need to elect more R's!
1010110544605581312 Our great Judge Jeanine Pirro is out with a new book, Liars, Leakers and Liberals, the Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy, which is fantastic. Go get it!
1009935968164630528 You cannot pass legislation on immigration whether it be for safety and security or any other reason including heart, without getting Dem votes. Problem is, they don't care about security and R's do. Zero Dems voted to support the Goodlatte Bill. They won't vote for anything!
1009928980475138048 We have to maintain strong borders or we will no longer have a country that we can be proud of Ã¢ and if we show any weakness, millions of people will journey into our country.
1009916650622251009 I REALLY DON'T CARE, DO U? written on the back of Melania's jacket, refers to the Fake News Media. Melania has learned how dishonest they are, and she truly no longer cares!
1009900449456115719 Big Supreme Court win on internet sales tax - about time! Big victory for fairness and for our country. Great victory for consumers and retailers.
1009900306694656002 Farm Bill just passed in the House. So happy to see work requirements included. Big win for the farmers!
1009900144861634561 I was thrilled to be back in Minnesota for a roundtable with hardworking American Patriots. Thank you!
1009895079631351808 The real big story that affects everybody in America is the success of @POTUS's TAX CUT package and what it's done for our economy... @Varneyco
1009844059211366401 My Administration is acting swiftly to address the illegal immigration crisis on the Southern Border. Loopholes in our immigration laws all supported by extremist open border Democrats...and that's what they are - they're extremist open border Democrats....
1009807715798044672 Democrats want open Borders, where anyone can come into our Country, and stay. This is Nancy Pelosi's dream. It won't happen!
1009796154220072960 Henry McMaster has done a great job as Governor of South Carolina. The state is BOOMING, with jobs and new industry setting records. He is tough on Crime and Strong on Borders, Healthcare, the Military and our great Vets. Henry has my full and complete Endrosement! #MAGA
1009785143635206149 What is the purpose of the House doing good immigration bills when you need 9 votes by Democrats in the Senate, and the Dems are only looking to Obstruct (which they feel is good for them in the Mid-Terms). Republicans must get rid of the stupid Filibuster Rule-it is killing you!
1009780708381024258 Last night in Minnesota was incredible. What a crowd!
1009779791858413569 Henry McMaster has done a great job as Governor of South Carolina. The State is BOOMING, with jobs and new industry setting records. He is tough on Crime and strong on Borders, Health Care, the Mititary and our great Vets. Henry has my full and complete Endorsement! #MAGA
1009777520659652609 I will be going the Columbia, South Carolina, on Monday night to do a campaign speech for one of my very early supporters, a man who truly loves the people of South Carolina, Governor Henry McMaster. Henry worked so hard & was so loyal to me that I look forward to reciprocating!
1009775416456941568 The Border has been a big mess and problem for many years. At some point Schumer and Pelosi, who are weak on Crime and Border security, will be forced to do a real deal, so easy, that solves this long time problem. Schumer used to want Border security - now he'll take Crime!
1009770941604298753 We shouldn't be hiring judges by the thousands, as our ridiculous immigration laws demand, we should be changing our laws, building the Wall, hire Border Agents and Ice and not let people come into our country based on the legal phrase they are told to say as their password.
1009638183091359744 Just returning from the Great State of Minnesota where we had an incredible rally with 9,000 people, and at least 10,000 who could not get in - I will return! Congratulations to @PeteStauber who is loved and respected in Minnesota!
1009602111133442048 Thank you Duluth, Minnesota. Together, we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
1009579307847553024 So sorry, people wanting to get into the already packed arena - I LOVE YOU ALL!
1009555147108696064 Just landed in Duluth, Minnesota. Two events planned - looking forward to them and being with @PeteStauber and his wonderful family!
1009536237881847808 Don't worry, the Republicans, and your President, will fix it!
1009534957440516096 Look what Fake ABC News put out. I guess they had it prepared from the 13 Angry Democrats leading the Witch Hunt! #StopTheBias
1009527495043923968 Had a great meeting with the House GOP last night at the Capitol. They applauded and laughed loudly when I mentioned my experience with Mark Sanford. I have never been a fan of his!
1009435777992884227 FBI texts have revealed anti-Trump Bias. @FoxNews Big News, but the Fake News doesn't want to cover. Total corruption - the Witch Hunt has turned out to be a scam! At some point soon the Mainstream Media will have to cover correctly, too big a story!
1009431025817092097 It's the Democrats fault, they won't give us the votes needed to pass good immigration legislation. They want open borders, which breeds horrible crime. Republicans want security. But I am working on something - it never ends!
1009411866475532288 The Fake News is not mentioning the safety and security of our Country when talking about illegal immigration. Our immigration laws are the weakest and worst anywhere in the world, and the Dems will do anything not to change them & to obstruct-want open borders which means crime!
1009258943175168002 Earlier today, @FLOTUS Melania and I were honored to welcome King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia of Spain to the @WhiteHouse!Ã°Å¸ÂºÃ°Å¸Â¸Ã°Å¸ÂªÃ°Å¸Â¸
1009241032100335616 Homeland Security @SecNielsen did a fabulous job yesterday at the press conference explaining security at the border and for our country, while at the same time recommending changes to obsolete & nasty laws, which force family separation. We want heart and security in America!
1009134789838843905 I want to take a moment to address the current illegal immigration crisis on the Southern Border...it has been going on for many, many decades...
1009127586528661504 THANK YOU @NFIB! #NFIB75
1009094070638084118 Join me tomorrow in Duluth, Minnesota for a #MAGA Rally! Tickets:
1009076294615814145 #CHANGETHELAWS Now is the best opportunity ever for Congress to change the ridiculous and obsolete laws on immigration. Get it done, always keeping in mind that we must have strong border security.
1009075083112050690 We must always arrest people coming into our Country illegally. Of the 12,000 children, 10,000 are being sent by their parents on a very dangerous trip, and only 2000 are with their parents, many of whom have tried to enter our Country illegally on numerous occasions.
1009071403918864385 Democrats are the problem. They don't care about crime and want illegal immigrants, no matter how bad they may be, to pour into and infest our Country, like MS-13. They can't win on their terrible policies, so they view them as potential voters!
1009071378371313664 If you don't have Borders, you don't have a Country!
1009071330661142533 Crime in Germany is up 10% plus (officials do not want to report these crimes) since migrants were accepted. Others countries are even worse. Be smart America!
1009071326219395073 I can't think of something more concerning than a law enforcement officer suggesting that their going to use their powers to affect an election! Inspector General Horowitz on what was going on with numerous people regarding my election. A Rigged Witch Hunt!p
1008732992481710081 Comey gave Strozk his marching orders. Mueller is Comey's best friend. Witch Hunt!
1008725438972211200 If President Obama (who got nowhere with North Korea and would have had to go to war with many millions of people being killed) had gotten along with North Korea and made the initial steps toward a deal that I have, the Fake News would have named him a national hero!
1008709364939677697 It is the Democrats fault for being weak and ineffective with Boarder Security and Crime. Tell them to start thinking about the people devastated by Crime coming from illegal immigration. Change the laws!
1008708576628625408 Children are being used by some of the worst criminals on earth as a means to enter our country. Has anyone been looking at the Crime taking place south of the border. It is historic, with some countries the most dangerous places in the world. Not going to happen in the U.S.
1008696952559734787 We don't want what is happening with immigration in Europe to happen with us!
1008696508697513985 The people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition. Crime in Germany is way up. Big mistake made all over Europe in allowing millions of people in who have so strongly and violently changed their culture!
1008692333771132929 Why don't the Democrats give us the votes to fix the world's worst immigration laws? Where is the outcry for the killings and crime being caused by gangs and thugs, including MS-13, coming into our country illegally?
1008515606751084544 The highest level of bias I've ever witnessed in any law enforcement officer. Trey Gowdy on the FBI's own, Peter Strzok. Also remember that they all worked for Slippery James Comey and that Comey is best friends with Robert Mueller. A really sick deal, isn't it?
1008511869970255872 The Democrats should get together with their Republican counterparts and work something out on Border Security & Safety. Don't wait until after the election because you are going to lose!
1008510118395293699 Why was the FBI's sick loser, Peter Strzok, working on the totally discredited Mueller team of 13 Angry & Conflicted Democrats, when Strzok was giving Crooked Hillary a free pass yet telling his lover, lawyer Lisa Page, that we'll stop Trump from becoming President? Witch Hunt!
1008506045373845504 Why was the FBI giving so much information to the Fake News Media. They are not supposed to be doing that, and knowing the enemy of the people Fake News, they put their own spin on it - truth doesn't matter to them!
1008362351807037441 WITCH HUNT! There was no Russian Collusion. Oh, I see, there was no Russian Collusion, so now they look for obstruction on the no Russian Collusion. The phony Russian Collusion was a made up Hoax. Too bad they didn't look at Crooked Hillary like this. Double Standard!
1008340100877570048 Washington Post employees want to go on strike because Bezos isn't paying them enough. I think a really long strike would be a great idea. Employees would get more money and we would get rid of Fake News for an extended period of time! Is @WaPo a registered lobbyist?
1008335560988078080 Our economy is perhaps BETTER than it has ever been. Companies doing really well, and moving back to America, and jobs numbers are the best in 44 years.
1008333717545410560 The denuclearization deal with North Korea is being praised and celebrated all over Asia. They are so happy! Over here, in our country, some people would rather see this historic deal fail than give Trump a win, even if it does save potentially millions & millions of lives!
1008330598363090944 Holding back the war games during the negotiations was my request because they are VERY EXPENSIVE and set a bad light during a good faith negotiation. Also, quite provocative. Can start up immediately if talks break down, which I hope will not happen!
1008328413210398720 Funny how the Fake News, in a coordinated effort with each other, likes to say I gave sooo much to North Korea because I met. That's because that's all they have to disparage! We got so much for peace in the world, & more is being added in finals. Even got our hostages/remains!
1008326335083761664 Daniel Henninger of The Wall Street Journal: This IG Report makes it clear, as did Rod Rosenstein's memo, that Trump was absolutely justified, unquestionably justified, in firing Jim Comey. So I think the Mueller Investigation is on pretty weak grounds right now. Witch Hunt!
1008317842264088576 Please clear up the Fake News!
1008316495733186560 Chuck Schumer said the Summit was what the Texans call all cattle and no hat. Thank you Chuck, but are you sure you got that right? No more nuclear testing or rockets flying all over the place, blew up launch sites. Hostages already back, hero remains coming home & much more!
1007986538985197568 The IG Report totally destroys James Comey and all of his minions including the great lovers, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, who started the disgraceful Witch Hunt against so many innocent people. It will go down as a dark and dangerous period in American History!
1007985231985627143 The IG Report totally distroys James Comey and all of his minions including the great lovers, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, who started the disgraceful Witch Hunt against so many innocent people. It will go down as a dark and dangerous period in American History!
1007974129474121728 My supporters are the smartest, strongest, most hard working and most loyal that we have seen in our countries history. It is a beautiful thing to watch as we win elections and gather support from all over the country. As we get stronger, so does our country. Best numbers ever!
1007972046666690561 Democrats can fix their forced family breakup at the Border by working with Republicans on new legislation, for a change! This is why we need more Republicans elected in November. Democrats are good at only three things, High Taxes, High Crime and Obstruction. Sad!
1007752687792910336 Great discussions with European Union Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and EU Council President Donald Tusk at the #G7Summit in Canada last week.
1007750530976927744 The Fake News Media said that I did not get along with other Leaders at the #G7Summit in Canada. They are once again, WRONG!
1007745343306584064 I have a great relationship with Angela Merkel of Germany, but the Fake News Media only shows the bad photos (implying anger) of negotiating an agreement - where I am asking for things that no other American President would ask for!
1007681553676283904 I've had to beat 17 very talented people including the Bush Dynasty, then I had to beat the Clinton Dynasty, and now I have to beat a phony Witch Hunt and all of the dishonest people covered in the IG Report...and never forget the Fake News Media. It never ends!
1007679422865006593 Wow, what a tough sentence for Paul Manafort, who has represented Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole and many other top political people and campaigns. Didn't know Manafort was the head of the Mob. What about Comey and Crooked Hillary and all of the others? Very unfair!
1007671131841671169 The Democrats are forcing the breakup of families at the Border with their horrible and cruel legislative agenda. Any Immigration Bill MUST HAVE full funding for the Wall, end Catch & Release, Visa Lottery and Chain, and go to Merit Based Immigration. Go for it! WIN!
1007594445104189441 Donald Trump was 100% right to fire James Comey. Mark Levin
1007592042124513283 Why in the world didn't Barack Obama fire this guy (Comey)? asks Mark Levin!
1007591075601637376 Wow, the highest rated (by far) morning show, @foxandfriends, is on the Front Lawn of the White House. Maybe I'll have to take an unannounced trip down to see them?
1007589800667435011 U.S.A. Jobs numbers are the BEST in 44 years. If my opponent (the Democrats) had won the election, they would have raised taxes substantially and increased regulations - the economy, and jobs, would have been a disaster!
1007580091692568576 Thank you for all of the compliments on getting the World Cup to come to the U.S.A., Mexico and Canada. I worked hard on this, along with a Great Team of talented people. We never fail, and it will be a great World Cup! A special thanks to Bob Kraft for excellent advice.
1007577375905861637 The IG Report is a total disaster for Comey, his minions and sadly, the FBI. Comey will now officially go down as the worst leader, by far, in the history of the FBI. I did a great service to the people in firing him. Good Instincts. Christopher Wray will bring it proudly back!
1007572229935202304 FBI Agent Peter Strzok, who headed the Clinton & Russia investigations, texted to his lover Lisa Page, in the IG Report, that we'll stop candidate Trump from becoming President. Doesn't get any lower than that!
1007300111481888768 Happy 243rd Birthday to the @USArmy! Thank you for your bravery, sacrifices, and dedication to the U.S.A. We love you!
1007278825661784064 ....Schneiderman, who ran the Clinton campaign in New York, never had the guts to bring this ridiculous case, which lingered in their office for almost 2 years. Now he resigned his office in disgrace, and his disciples brought it when we would not settle.
1007278788009480192 The sleazy New York Democrats, and their now disgraced (and run out of town) A.G. Eric Schneiderman, are doing everything they can to sue me on a foundation that took in $18,800,000 and gave out to charity more money than it took in, $19,200,000. I won't settle this case!...
1007278701996802048 So, the Democrats make up a phony crime, Collusion with the Russians, pay a fortune to make the crime sound real, illegally leak (Comey) classified information so that a Special Councel will be appointed, and then Collude to make this pile of garbage take on life in Fake News!
1007278671097417729 Now that I am back from Singapore, where we had a great result with respect to North Korea, the thought process must sadly go back to the Witch Hunt, always remembering that there was No Collusion and No Obstruction of the fabricated No Crime.
1007239837529800705 The Republican Party is starting to show very big numbers. People are starting to see what is being done. Results are speaking loudly. North Korea and our greatest ever economy are leading the way!
1007002252467458048 Congratulations to @KevinCramer on his huge win in North Dakota. We need Kevin in the Senate, and I strongly endorse him. Heidi voted NO on our Tax Cuts, and always will vote no when we need her. Kevin is strong on Crime & Borders, big on Cutting Taxes!
1006993862152392704 Congratulations to Danny Tarkanian on his big GOP primary win in Nevada. Danny worked hard an got a great result. Looking good in November!
1006992524366503941 Senator Claire McCaskill of the GREAT State of Missouri flew around in a luxurious private jet during her RV tour of the state. RV's are not for her. People are really upset, so phony! Josh Hawley should win big, and has my full endorsement.
1006891643985854464 So funny to watch the Fake News, especially NBC and CNN. They are fighting hard to downplay the deal with North Korea. 500 days ago they would have begged for this deal-looked like war would break out. Our Country's biggest enemy is the Fake News so easily promulgated by fools!
1006866982833131520 Oil prices are too high, OPEC is at it again. Not good!
1006866089110892545 The U.S., together with Mexico and Canada, just got the World Cup. Congratulations - a great deal of hard work!
1006856219200548864 We save a fortune by not doing war games, as long as we are negotiating in good faith - which both sides are!
1006839007492308992 Before taking office people were assuming that we were going to War with North Korea. President Obama said that North Korea was our biggest and most dangerous problem. No longer - sleep well tonight!
1006837823469735936 Just landed - a long trip, but everybody can now feel much safer than the day I took office. There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea. Meeting with Kim Jong Un was an interesting and very positive experience. North Korea has great potential for the future!
1006837459794251776 Congratulations to Corey Stewart for his great victory for Senator from Virginia. Now he runs against a total stiff, Tim Kaine, who is weak on crime and borders, and wants to raise your taxes through the roof. Don't underestimate Corey, a major chance of winning!
1006833568641777664 ...realize the economy is the best it's ever been with employment being at an all time high, and many companies pouring back into our country. Wake up Punchy!
1006833565022031873 Robert De Niro, a very Low IQ individual, has received too many shots to the head by real boxers in movies. I watched him last night and truly believe he may be punch-drunk. I guess he doesn't...
1006832813499269120 My political representatives didn't want me to get involved in the Mark Sanford primary thinking that Sanford would easily win - but with a few hours left I felt that Katie was such a good candidate, and Sanford was so bad, I had to give it a shot. Congrats to Katie Arrington!
1006706273746735105 A year ago the pundits & talking heads, people that couldn't do the job before, were begging for conciliation and peace - please meet, don't go to war. Now that we meet and have a great relationship with Kim Jong Un, the same haters shout out, you shouldn't meet, do not meet!
1006694541083021312 The World has taken a big step back from potential Nuclear catastrophe! No more rocket launches, nuclear testing or research! The hostages are back home with their families. Thank you to Chairman Kim, our day together was historic!
1006690543403855872 I want to thank Chairman Kim for taking the first bold step toward a bright new future for his people. Our unprecedented meeting Ã¢ the first between an American President and a leader of North Korea Ã¢ proves that real change is possible!
1006688157096501248 There is no limit to what NoKo can achieve when it gives up its nuclear weapons and embraces commerce & engagement w/ the world. Chairman Kim has before him the opportunity to be remembered as the leader who ushered in a glorious new era of security & prosperity for his citizens!
1006681862301933568 It's time for another #MAGA rally. Join me in Duluth, Minnesota on Wednesday, June 20th at 6:30pm!
1006648161538961408 Here is the video, A Story of Opportunity that I shared with Kim Jong-un at the #SingaporeSummit
1006640694264397824 ...realize the economy is the best it's ever been with employment being at an all time high, and many companies pouring back into our country. Wake up Punchy!
1006640689843560448 Robert De Niro, a very Low IQ individual, has received to many shots to the head by real boxers in movies. I watched him last night and truly believe he may be punch-drunk. I guess he doesn't...
1006637378088284160 ...Got along great with Kim Jong-un who wants to see wonderful things for his country. As I said earlier today: Anyone can make war, but only the most courageous can make peace! #SingaporeSummit
1006637373629722624 Heading back home from Singapore after a truly amazing visit. Great progress was made on the denuclearization of North Korea. Hostages are back home, will be getting the remains of our great heroes back to their families, no missiles shot, no research happening, sites closing...
1006630395067039744 Mark Sanford has been very unhelpful to me in my campaign to MAGA. He is MIA and nothing but trouble. He is better off in Argentina. I fully endorse Katie Arrington for Congress in SC, a state I love. She is tough on crime and will continue our fight to lower taxes. VOTE Katie!
1006619872367804416 I strongly endorse Adam Laxalt for Governor of Nevada. Adam is smart, works hard, and knows how to win. He will be a great Governor. Also, will fight hard to lower your taxes and is tough on crime!
1006334219759575040 Our Great Larry Kudlow, who has been working so hard on trade and the economy, has just suffered a heart attack. He is now in Walter Reed Medical Center.
1006326057375584261 Just won big Supreme Court decision on Voting! Great News!
1006296018210603008 The fact that I am having a meeting is a major loss for the U.S., say the haters & losers. We have our hostages, testing, research and all missle launches have stoped, and these pundits, who have called me wrong from the beginning, have nothing else they can say! We will be fine!
1006293144911085568 Stock Market up almost 40% since the Election, with 7 Trillion Dollars of U.S. value built throughout the economy. Lowest unemployment rate in many decades, with Black & Hispanic unemployment lowest in History, and Female unemployment lowest in 21 years. Highest confidence ever!
1006286790536323074 Meetings between staffs and representatives are going well and quickly....but in the end, that doesn't matter. We will all know soon whether or not a real deal, unlike those of the past, can happen!
1006081372912484353 Thank you Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong!
1006003345360908295 Sorry, we cannot let our friends, or enemies, take advantage of us on Trade anymore. We must put the American worker first!
1005989290520739845 Great to be in Singapore, excitement in the air!
1005988633747312640 ....Germany pays 1% (slowly) of GDP towards NATO, while we pay 4% of a MUCH larger GDP. Does anybody believe that makes sense? We protect Europe (which is good) at great financial loss, and then get unfairly clobbered on Trade. Change is coming!
1005985339121504256 ....And add to that the fact that the U.S. pays close to the entire cost of NATO-protecting many of these same countries that rip us off on Trade (they pay only a fraction of the cost-and laugh!). The European Union had a $151 Billion Surplus-should pay much more for Military!
1005982266496094209 Why should I, as President of the United States, allow countries to continue to make Massive Trade Surpluses, as they have for decades, while our Farmers, Workers & Taxpayers have such a big and unfair price to pay? Not fair to the PEOPLE of America! $800 Billion Trade Deficit...
1005979207544000512 Fair Trade is now to be called Fool Trade if it is not Reciprocal. According to a Canada release, they make almost 100 Billion Dollars in Trade with U.S. (guess they were bragging and got caught!). Minimum is 17B. Tax Dairy from us at 270%. Then Justin acts hurt when called out!
1005586562959093760 PM Justin Trudeau of Canada acted so meek and mild during our @G7 meetings only to give a news conference after I left saying that, US Tariffs were kind of insulting and he will not be pushed around. Very dishonest & weak. Our Tariffs are in response to his of 270% on dairy!
1005586152076689408 Based on Justin's false statements at his news conference, and the fact that Canada is charging massive Tariffs to our U.S. farmers, workers and companies, I have instructed our U.S. Reps not to endorse the Communique as we look at Tariffs on automobiles flooding the U.S. Market!
1005554692133249026 Ã¢Â¦Create peace and great prosperity for his land. I look forward to meeting him and have a feeling that this one-time opportunity will not be wasted!
1005554687678922752 I am on my way to Singapore where we have a chance to achieve a truly wonderful result for North Korea and the World. It will certainly be an exciting day and I know that Kim Jong-un will work very hard to do something that has rarely been done before...
1005554429087514624 The United States will not allow other countries to impose massive Tariffs and Trade Barriers on its farmers, workers and companies. While sending their product into our country tax free. We have put up with Trade Abuse for many decades Ã¢ and that is long enough.
1005554268009422849 ...U.S.A. Trade. They fully understand where I am coming from. After many decades, fair and reciprocal Trade will happen!
1005554263601250304 Just left the @G7 Summit in beautiful Canada. Great meetings and relationships with the six Country Leaders especially since they know I cannot allow them to apply large Tariffs and strong barriers to...
1005550889422110721 Just met the new Prime Minister of Italy, @GiuseppeConteIT, a really great guy. He will be honored in Washington, at the @WhiteHouse, shortly. He will do a great job - the people of Italy got it right!
1005548570332631040 Henry McMaster loves the people of South Carolina and was with me from the beginning. He is strong on Crime and Borders, great for our Military and our Vets. He is doing a fantastic job as your Governor, and has my full endorsement, a special guy. Vote on Tuesday!
1005479740000624640 @G7 Press Briefing in Charlevoix, Canada, prior to departing for Singapore!
1005304018741035008 My thoughts and prayers are with the families of our serviceman who was killed and his fellow servicemen who were wounded in Somalia. They are truly all HEROES.
1005259274568728576 My thoughts and prayers are with the families of our serviceman who was killed and his fellow servicemen who were wounded in Somolia. They are truly all HEROES.
1005047468705439744 I am heading for Canada and the G-7 for talks that will mostly center on the long time unfair trade practiced against the United States. From there I go to Singapore and talks with North Korea on Denuclearization. Won't be talking about the Russian Witch Hunt Hoax for a while!
1005045008746057728 Congratulations to the Washington Capitals on their GREAT play and winning the Stanley Cup Championship. Alex Ovechkin, the team captain, was spectacular - a true Superstar! D.C. is popping, in many ways. What a time!
1005033088202756097 Looking forward to straightening out unfair Trade Deals with the G-7 countries. If it doesn't happen, we come out even better!
1005030839019802625 Canada charges the U.S. a 270% tariff on Dairy Products! They didn't tell you that, did they? Not fair to our farmers!
1005028243760611328 Obama, Schumer and Pelosi did NOTHING about North Korea, and now weak on Crime, High Tax Schumer is telling me what to do at the Summit the Dems could never set up. Schumer failed with North Korea and Iran, we don't need his advice!
1004909785547001856 Why isn't the European Union and Canada informing the public that for years they have used massive Trade Tariffs and non-monetary Trade Barriers against the U.S. Totally unfair to our farmers, workers & companies. Take down your tariffs & barriers or we will more than match you!
1004871827406061573 Prime Minister Trudeau is being so indignant, bringing up the relationship that the U.S. and Canada had over the many years and all sorts of other things...but he doesn't bring up the fact that they charge us up to 300% on dairy Ã¢ hurting our Farmers, killing our Agriculture!
1004846478253273088 Please tell Prime Minister Trudeau and President Macron that they are charging the U.S. massive tariffs and create non-monetary barriers. The EU trade surplus with the U.S. is $151 Billion, and Canada keeps our farmers and others out. Look forward to seeing them tomorrow.
1004815794365255680 Great day of meetings with Prime Minister @AbeShinzo of Japan!
1004814196247318528 PM Abe and I are also working to improve the trading relationship between the U.S. and Japan, something we have to do. The U.S. seeks a bilateral deal with Japan that is based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity. We're working hard to reduce our trade imbalance...
1004813164066766848 Today, I am greatly honored to welcome my good friend, PM Abe of Japan to the @WhiteHouse. Over the past 16 months the Prime Minister and I have worked closely together to address common challenges, of which there are many...
1004775164834349061 It's my great honor to welcome Prime Minister @AbeShinzo back to the @WhiteHouse!Ã°Å¸ÂºÃ°Å¸Â¸Ã°Å¸Â¯Ã°Å¸

1004750401709715457 MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
1004743621587894272 The Obama Administration is now accused of trying to give Iran secret access to the financial system of the United States. This is totally illegal. Perhaps we could get the 13 Angry Democrats to divert some of their energy to this matter (as Comey would call it). Investigate!
1004742470700322816 When will people start saying, thank you, Mr. President, for firing James Comey?
1004726490058182656 Our Justice Department must not let Awan & Debbie Wasserman Schultz off the hook. The Democrat I.T. scandal is a key to much of the corruption we see today. They want to make a plea deal to hide what is on their Server. Where is Server? Really bad!
1004724915562598400 Looking forward to seeing my friend Prime Minister @AbeShinzo of Japan at noon. Will be discussing North Korea and Trade.
1004722061808427008 How could Jeff Flake, who is setting record low polling numbers in Arizona and was therefore humiliatingly forced out of his own Senate seat without even a fight (and who doesn't have a clue), think about running for office, even a lower one, again? Let's face it, he's a Flake!
1004711557291560960 When and where will all of the many conflicts of interest be listed by the 13 Angry Democrats (plus) working on the Witch Hunt Hoax. There has never been a group of people on a case so biased or conflicted. It is all a Democrat Excuse for LOSING the Election. Where is the server?
1004710919853760512 Alan Dershowitz, Harvard Law Professor: It all proves that we never needed a Special Counsel....All of this could have been done by the Justice Dept. Don't need a multi-million dollar group of people with a target on someone's back. Not the way Justice should operate. So true!
1004709222196699136 Alan Dershowitz, Harvard Law Professor: It all proves that we never needed a Special Councel....All of this could have been done by the Justice Dept. Don't need a multi-million dollar group of people with a target on someone's back. Not the way Justice should operate. So true!
1004696266297827328 Good luck to Alice Johnson. Have a wonderful life!
1004693718945984512 Isn't it Ironic? Getting ready to go to the G-7 in Canada to fight for our country on Trade (we have the worst trade deals ever made), then off to Singapore to meet with North Korea & the Nuclear Problem...But back home we still have the 13 Angry Democrats pushing the Witch Hunt!
1004478326336040960 Thank you to everyone at @FEMA HQ for today's briefing on preparations for the upcoming hurricane season. Disaster response and recovery is best achieved when it's federally supported, state managed, and locally executed Ã¢ this is the successful model we will continue to build.
1004455146867306496 We must always protect those who protect us. Today, it was my great honor to sign the #VAMissionAct and to make Veterans Choice the permanent law of the land!
1004447235046862850 Today we mark another milestone: the 74th anniversary of #DDay, the Allied invasion of Normandy. On June 6, 1944, more than 70,000 brave young Americans charged out of landing craft, jumped out of airplanes, and stormed into hell...
1004373239194320900 Congratulations to Dana Rohrabacher on his big California win. We are proud of you Dana!
1004363400674234368 Many more Republican voters showed up yesterday than the Fake News thought possible. The political pundits just don't get what is going on out there - or they do get it but refuse to report the facts! Remember, Dems are High Tax, High Crime, easy to beat!
1004360833407815680 ...Four reporters spotted Melania in the White House last week walking merrily along to a meeting. They never reported the sighting because it would hurt the sick narrative that she was living in a different part of the world, was really ill, or whatever. Fake News is really bad!
1004359335399641089 The Fake News Media has been so unfair, and vicious, to my wife and our great First Lady, Melania. During her recovery from surgery they reported everything from near death, to facelift, to left the W.H. (and me) for N.Y. or Virginia, to abuse. All Fake, she is doing really well!
1004356576671666179 Gold Star father, Ceejay Metcalf, whose great son Michael was just honored at the White House, was fantastic this morning on @foxandfriends. He is a special man!
1004351340041199616 Great night for Republicans! Congratulations to John Cox on a really big number in California. He can win. Even Fake News CNN said the Trump impact was really big, much bigger than they ever thought possible. So much for the big Blue Wave, it may be a big Red Wave. Working hard!
1004211778837012481 Mitch McConnell announced he will cancel the Senate's August Recess. Great, maybe the Democrats will finally get something done other than their acceptance of High Crime and High Taxes. We need Border Security!
1004174436759691266 ....The greatest Witch Hunt in political history!
1004172786359848960 ...This is a level of criminality beyond the pale. This is such a grave abuse of power and authority, it's like nothing else we've seen in our history. This makes the Nixon Watergate burglary look like keystone cop stuff
1004171953404628998 Chris Farrell, Judicial Watch. They were running an operation to undermine a candidate for President of the U.S. These are all violations of law. This is intelligence tradecraft to steer an election. There's nothing more grave when it comes to abuse of our intelligence system...
1004166633349361664 Great interview by @LouDobbs with Chris Farrell of Judicial Watch concerning the governments counter-intelligence operation into the Trump Campaign. SPYGATE at the highest level. Who would believe?
1004160401658073090 Wow, Strzok-Page, the incompetent & corrupt FBI lovers, have texts referring to a counter-intelligence operation into the Trump Campaign dating way back to December, 2015. SPYGATE is in full force! Is the Mainstream Media interested yet? Big stuff!
1004092260475162624 Imagine how much wasteful spending we'd save if we didn't have Chuck and Nancy standing in our way! For years, Democrats in Congress have depleted our military and busted our budgets on needless spending, and to what end? No more.
1004092104488947719 The HISTORIC Rescissions Package we've proposed would cut $15,000,000,000 in Wasteful Spending! We are getting our government back on track.
1003998873004773376 Terrific new book out by the wonderful Harris Faulkner, 9 Rules of Engagement. Harris shares lessons from a military family. Enjoy!
1003997350791188482 Senator @RogerWicker of Mississippi has done everything necessary to Make America Great Again! Get out and vote for Roger, he has my total support!
1003995933540044800 Vote for Congressman Devin Nunes, a true American Patriot the likes of which we rarely see in our modern day world....he truly loves our country and deserves everyone's support!
1003987298072002565 Get the vote out in California today for Rep. Kevin McCarthy and all of the great GOP candidates for Congress. Keep our country out of the hands of High Tax, High Crime Nancy Pelosi.
1003985427970314246 In High Tax, High Crime California, be sure to get out and vote for Republican John Cox for Governor. He will make a BIG difference!
1003969399148118016 Separating families at the Border is the fault of bad legislation passed by the Democrats. Border Security laws should be changed but the Dems can't get their act together! Started the Wall.
1003967400130285569 ...@NASCAR and Champion @MartinTruex_Jr were recently at the White House. It was a great day for a great sport!
1003963157734453249 Meeting in Singapore with North Korea will hopefully be the start of something big...we will soon see!
1003962584352030720 The Russian Witch Hunt Hoax continues, all because Jeff Sessions didn't tell me he was going to recuse himself...I would have quickly picked someone else. So much time and money wasted, so many lives ruined...and Sessions knew better than most that there was No Collusion!
1003960114989207552 We have had many Championship teams recently at the White House including the Chicago Cubs, Houston Astros, Pittsburgh Penguins, New England Patriots, Alabama and Clemson National Champions, and many others. National Anthem & more great music today at 3:00 P.M.
1003956743133650944 We will proudly be playing the National Anthem and other wonderful music celebrating our Country today at 3 P.M., The White House, with the United States Marine Band and the United States Army Chorus. Honoring America! NFL, no escaping to Locker Rooms!
1003952348962619392 The U.S. has an increased economic value of more than 7 Trillion Dollars since the Election. May be the best economy in the history of our country. Record Jobs numbers. Nice!
1003949263481696256 What is taking so long with the Inspector General's Report on Crooked Hillary and Slippery James Comey. Numerous delays. Hope Report is not being changed and made weaker! There are so many horrible things to tell, the public has the right to know. Transparency!
1003832766511894528 The Philadelphia Eagles Football Team was invited to the White House. Unfortunately, only a small number of players decided to come, and we canceled the event. Staying in the Locker Room for the playing of our National Anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling. Sorry!
1003806272360239104 Big Supreme Court ruling for Baker just out!
1003738744061603843 In many ways this is the greatest economy in the HISTORY of America and the best time EVER to look for a job!
1003738642903420928 The Fake News Media is desperate to distract from the economy and record setting economic numbers and so they keep talking about the phony Russian Witch Hunt.
1003714332973322240 #500Days of American Greatness:
1003637916919320577 The appointment of the Special Counsel is totally UNCONSTITUTIONAL! Despite that, we play the game because I, unlike the Democrats, have done nothing wrong!
1003634405036961793 Farmers have not been doing well for 15 years. Mexico, Canada, China and others have treated them unfairly. By the time I finish trade talks, that will change. Big trade barriers against U.S. farmers, and other businesses, will finally be broken. Massive trade deficits no longer!
1003624231408676864 The appointment of the Special Councel is totally UNCONSTITUTIONAL! Despite that, we play the game because I, unlike the Democrats, have done nothing wrong!
1003618276293988352 The U.S. has made such bad trade deals over so many years that we can only WIN!
1003617811254710273 China already charges a tax of 16% on soybeans. Canada has all sorts of trade barriers on our Agricultural products. Not acceptable!
1003616210922147841 As has been stated by numerous legal scholars, I have the absolute right to PARDON myself, but why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong? In the meantime, the never ending Witch Hunt, led by 13 very Angry and Conflicted Democrats (& others) continues into the mid-terms!
1003612459855466497 This is the best time EVER to look for a job. James Freeman of WSJ.
1003611857272360960 ....We had Repeal & Replace done (and the saving to our country of one trillion dollars) except for one person, but it is getting done anyway. Individual Mandate is gone and great, less expensive plans will be announced this month. Drug prices coming down & Right to Try!
1003601217111707649 This is my 500th. Day in Office and we have accomplished a lot - many believe more than any President in his first 500 days. Massive Tax & Regulation Cuts, Military & Vets, Lower Crime & Illegal Immigration, Stronger Borders, Judgeships, Best Economy & Jobs EVER, and much more...
1003328970069331968 Mark Penn Why are there people from the Clinton Foundation on the Mueller Staff? Why is there an Independent Counsel? To go after people and their families for unrelated offenses...Constitution was set up to prevent this...Stormtrooper tactics almost. A disgrace!
1003326698228764672 Mark Penn Why are there people from the Clinton Foundation on the Mueller Staff? Why is there an Independent Councel? To go after people and their families for unrelated offenses...Constitution was set up to prevent this...Stormtrooper tactics almost. A disgrace!
1003268646070874113 ....Paul Manafort came into the campaign very late and was with us for a short period of time (he represented Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole & many others over the years), but we should have been told that Comey and the boys were doing a number on him, and he wouldn't have been hired!
1003266374473519105 As only one of two people left who could become President, why wouldn't the FBI or Department of Justice have told me that they were secretly investigating Paul Manafort (on charges that were 10 years old and had been previously dropped) during my campaign? Should have told me!
1003259934417580033 Jesse Watters The only thing Trump obstructed was Hillary getting to the White House. So true!
1003024268756733952 When you're almost 800 Billion Dollars a year down on Trade, you can't lose a Trade War! The U.S. has been ripped off by other countries for years on Trade, time to get smart!
1003017786355015680 Why is it that the Wall Street Journal, though well meaning, never mentions the unfairness of the Tariffs routinely charged against the U.S. by other countries, or the many Billions of Dollars that the Tariffs we are now charging are, and will be, pouring into U.S. coffers?
1002971013313908738 The United States must, at long last, be treated fairly on Trade. If we charge a country ZERO to sell their goods, and they charge us 25, 50 or even 100 percent to sell ours, it is UNFAIR and can no longer be tolerated. That is not Free or Fair Trade, it is Stupid Trade!
1002968869043097600 There was No Collusion with Russia (except by the Democrats). When will this very expensive Witch Hunt Hoax ever end? So bad for our Country. Is the Special Counsel/Justice Department leaking my lawyers letters to the Fake News Media? Should be looking at Dems corruption instead?
1002965829175169025 There was No Collusion with Russia (except by the Democrats). When will this very expensive Witch Hunt Hoax ever end? So bad for our Country. Is the Special Councel/Justice Department leaking my lawyers letters to the Fake News Media? Should be looking at Dems corruption instead?
1002954515941941249 Real @FoxNews is doing great, Fake News CNN is dead!
1002951786301415424 Very surprised that China would be doing this?
1002946237652504576 Now this is a record that will never be broken!
1002892787803676673 ....$17 million spent, it's a scam Investigation. Americans are being worked. We now know there was Russian collusion, with Russians and the Democrats. The Mueller team is stacked with anti-Trumpers, who actually represented Clinton people (& gave $'s to Crooked H). Dan Bongino
1002884227753480193 John Brennan, no single figure in American history has done more to discredit the intelligence community than this liar. Not only is he a liar, he's a liar about being a liar. Dan Bongino on @foxandfriends
1002881893963051009 John Brennan, no single figure in American history has done more to discredit the Intelligence community than this liar. He's a liar about being a liar.
1002877499448152065 We ran out of words to describe how good the jobs numbers are. Neil Irwin of the @nytimes.
1002666307043647489 Today, it was my great honor to be with the brave men and women of the United States Coast Guard!
1002539852171304960 Canada has treated our Agricultural business and Farmers very poorly for a very long period of time. Highly restrictive on Trade! They must open their markets and take down their trade barriers! They report a really high surplus on trade with us. Do Timber & Lumber in U.S.?
1002510522032541701 Looking forward to seeing the employment numbers at 8:30 this morning.
1002508937445478402 Why aren't they firing no talent Samantha Bee for the horrible language used on her low ratings show? A total double standard but that's O.K., we are Winning, and will be doing so for a long time to come!
1002506360351846400 A.P. has just reported that the Russian Hoax Investigation has now cost our government over $17 million, and going up fast. No Collusion, except by the Democrats!
1002177521599860736 Will be giving a Full Pardon to Dinesh D'Souza today. He was treated very unfairly by our government!
1002176736761655298 Very good meetings with North Korea.
1002160516733853696 Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia! The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!
1002159087830827008 The corrupt Mainstream Media is working overtime not to mention the infiltration of people, Spies (Informants), into my campaign! Surveillance much?
1002156016060989445 Iger, where is my call of apology? You and ABC have offended millions of people, and they demand a response. How is Brian Ross doing? He tanked the market with an ABC lie, yet no apology. Double Standard!
1002141448232493056 RUSH LIMBAUGH If the FBI was so concerned, and if they weren't targeting Trump, they should have told Trump. If they were really concerned about the Russians infiltrating a campaign (hoax), then why not try to stop it? Why not tell Trump? Because they were pushing this scam.
1002027245131661312 The recusal of Jeff Sessions was an unforced betrayal of the President of the United States. JOE DIGENOVA, former U.S. Attorney.
1002023477531070464 The soon to be released book, The Russia Hoax, The Illicit Scheme To Clear Hillary Clinton And Frame Donald Trump, written by Gregg Jarrett, looks like a real deal big hit. The Phony Witch Hunt will be opened up for the world to see! Out in 5 weeks.
1001978774219644929 Very importantly, @RepDanDonovan will win for the Republicans in November...and his opponent will not. Remember Alabama. We can't take any chances on losing to a Nancy Pelosi controlled Democrat!
1001973090107248641 There is no one better to represent the people of N.Y. and Staten Island (a place I know very well) than @RepDanDonovan, who is strong on Borders & Crime, loves our Military & our Vets, voted for Tax Cuts and is helping me to Make America Great Again. Dan has my full endorsement!
1001961235838103552 Great meeting with @KimKardashian today, talked about prison reform and sentencing.
1001875884142362625 Moments ago, it was my great honor to sign #RightToTry into law!
1001873868498325504 With the #RightToTry Law I signed today, patients with life threatening illnesses will finally have access to experimental treatments that could improve or even cure their conditions. These are experimental treatments and products that have shown great promise...
1001873279597064194 Today I am proud to keep another promise to the American people as I sign the #RightToTry Legislation into law.
1001848460881035265 Bob Iger of ABC called Valerie Jarrett to let her know that ABC does not tolerate comments like those made by Roseanne Barr. Gee, he never called President Donald J. Trump to apologize for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC. Maybe I just didn't get the call?
1001834394359877633 The Failing and Corrupt @nytimes estimated the crowd last night at 1000 people, when in fact it was many times that number - and the arena was rockin'. This is the way they demean and disparage. They are very dishonest people who don't get me, and never did!
1001807216297627648 ....There are lots of really good lawyers in the country, he could have picked somebody else! And I wish I did!
1001807204519997442 ....chief law enforcement officer, and they told me later, Ã¢oh by the way I'm not going to be able to participate in the most important case in the office, I would be frustrated too...and that's how I read that - Senator Sessions, why didn't you tell me before I picked you.....
1001807174249713664 Rep.Trey Gowdy, I don't think so, I think what the President is doing is expressing frustration that Attorney General Sessions should have shared these reasons for recusal before he took the job, not afterward. If I were the President and I picked someone to be the country's....
1001455721588969472 The Fake Mainstream Media has, from the time I announced I was running for President, run the most highly sophisticated & dishonest Disinformation Campaign in the history of politics. No matter how well WE do, they find fault. But the forgotten men & women WON, I'm President!
1001424695126880258 Sorry, I've got to start focusing my energy on North Korea Nuclear, bad Trade Deals, VA Choice, the Economy, rebuilding the Military, and so much more, and not on the Rigged Russia Witch Hunt that should be investigating Clinton/Russia/FBI/Justice/Obama/Comey/Lynch etc.
1001420270094168064 Why aren't the 13 Angry and heavily conflicted Democrats investigating the totally Crooked Campaign of totally Crooked Hillary Clinton. It's a Rigged Witch Hunt, that's why! Ask them if they enjoyed her after election celebration!
1001417880116891650 The 13 Angry Democrats (plus people who worked 8 years for Obama) working on the rigged Russia Witch Hunt, will be MEDDLING with the mid-term elections, especially now that Republicans (stay tough!) are taking the lead in Polls. There was no Collusion, except by the Democrats!
1001415199516254208 This investigation involved far more surveillance than we ever had any idea about. It wasn't just a wiretap against a campaign aide...it was secretly gathering information on the Trump Campaign...people call that Spying...this is unprecedented and scandalous. Mollie Hemingway
1001410457092218880 We have put a great team together for our talks with North Korea. Meetings are currently taking place concerning Summit, and more. Kim Young Chol, the Vice Chairman of North Korea, heading now to New York. Solid response to my letter, thank you!
1001404640796336128 Democrats mistakenly tweet 2014 pictures from Obama's term showing children from the Border in steel cages. They thought it was recent pictures in order to make us look bad, but backfires. Dems must agree to Wall and new Border Protection for good of country...Bipartisan Bill!
1001220050995511298 California has a rare opportunity to turn things around and solve its high crime, high tax, problems - along with so many others. On June 5th., vote for GOP Gubernatorial Candidate JOHN COX, a really good and highly competent man. He'll Make California Great Again!
1001212077699149825 A Democratic lawmaker just introduced a bill to Repeal the GOP Tax Cuts (no chance). This is too good to be true for Republicans...Remember, the Nancy Pelosi Dems are also weak on Crime, the Border and want to be gentle and kind to MS-13 gang members...not good!
1001151001699803138 Our fallen heroes have not only written our history they have shaped our destiny. They saved the lives of the men and women with whom they served. They cared for their families more than anything in the world, they loved their families. They inspired their communities...
1001149793496977408 The heroes who rest in these hallowed fields, in cemeteries, battlefields, and burial grounds near and far are drawn the full tapestry of American life. They came from every generation from towering cities and wind swept prairies, from privilege and from poverty...
1001149367271686145 Thank you for joining us on this solemn day of remembrance. We are gathered here on the sacred soil of @ArlingtonNatl Cemetery to honor the lives and deeds of America's greatest heroes, the men and women who laid down their lives for our freedom. #MemorialDay
1001108964216537089 We now find out that the Obama Administration put the opposing campaigns presidential candidate, or his campaign, under investigation. That raises legitimate questions. I just find this really odd...this goes to the heart of our electoral system. Jonathan Turley on @FoxNews
1001103028626345984 Sally Yates is part of concerns people have raised about bias in the Justice Dept. I find her actions to be really quite unbelievable. Jonathan Turley
1001099771602456576 The President deserves some answers. @FoxNews in discussing SPYGATE.
1001085207825534976 Happy Memorial Day! Those who died for our great country would be very happy and proud at how well our country is doing today. Best economy in decades, lowest unemployment numbers for Blacks and Hispanics EVER (& women in 18years), rebuilding our Military and so much more. Nice!
1000837182297464832 Why didn't President Obama do something about the so-called Russian Meddling when he was told about it by the FBI before the Election? Because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win, and he didn't want to upset the apple cart! He was in charge, not me, and did nothing.
1000831304836018176 Our United States team has arrived in North Korea to make arrangements for the Summit between Kim Jong Un and myself. I truly believe North Korea has brilliant potential and will be a great economic and financial Nation one day. Kim Jong Un agrees with me on this. It will happen!
1000741764565753856 Why didn't the 13 Angry Democrats investigate the campaign of Crooked Hillary Clinton, many crimes, much Collusion with Russia? Why didn't the FBI take the Server from the DNC? Rigged Investigation!
1000726832843501570 Fantastic to have 400,000 GREAT MEN & WOMEN of Rolling Thunder in D.C. showing their patriotism. They love our Country, they love our Flag, they stand for our National Anthem! Thanks to Executive Director Artie Muller.
1000718611688943616 Who's going to give back the young and beautiful lives (and others) that have been devastated and destroyed by the phony Russia Collusion Witch Hunt? They journeyed down to Washington, D.C., with stars in their eyes and wanting to help our nation...They went back home in tatters!
1000465814192099330 When will the 13 Angry Democrats (& those who worked for President O), reveal their disqualifying Conflicts of Interest? It's been a long time now! Will they be indelibly written into the Report along with the fact that the only Collusion is with the Dems, Justice, FBI & Russia?
1000462031500099584 This whole Russia Probe is Rigged. Just an excuse as to why the Dems and Crooked Hillary lost the Election and States that haven't been lost in decades. 13 Angry Democrats, and all Dems if you include the people who worked for Obama for 8 years. #SPYGATE & CONFLICTS OF INTEREST!
1000458567147839488 With Spies, or Informants as the Democrats like to call them because it sounds less sinister (but it's not), all over my campaign, even from a very early date, why didn't the crooked highest levels of the FBI or Justice contact me to tell me of the phony Russia problem?
1000396430371106817 The Failing @nytimes quotes a senior White House official, who doesn't exist, as saying even if the meeting were reinstated, holding it on June 12 would be impossible, given the lack of time and the amount of planning needed. WRONG AGAIN! Use real people, not phony sources.
1000391997969092608 Unlike what the Failing and Corrupt New York Times would like people to believe, there is ZERO disagreement within the Trump Administration as to how to deal with North Korea...and if there was, it wouldn't matter. The @nytimes has called me wrong right from the beginning!
1000387893427351553 Thanks to very brave Teacher & Hero Jason Seaman of Noblesville, Indiana, for his heroic act in saving so many precious young lives. His quick and automatic action is being talked about all over the world!
1000385794115325952 Looking forward to seeing Joshua Holt this evening in the White House. The great people of Utah are Celebrating!
1000375761604370434 Put pressure on the Democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there parents once they cross the Border into the U.S. Catch and Release, Lottery and Chain must also go with it and we MUST continue building the WALL! DEMOCRATS ARE PROTECTING MS-13 THUGS.
1000366478846300165 Good news about the release of the American hostage from Venezuela. Should be landing in D.C. this evening and be in the White House, with his family, at about 7:00 P.M. The great people of Utah will be very happy!
1000174070061813761 We are having very productive talks with North Korea about reinstating the Summit which, if it does happen, will likely remain in Singapore on the same date, June 12th., and, if necessary, will be extended beyond that date.
1000152863035805696 ...but complain and obstruct. They made only bad deals (Iran) and their so-called Trade Deals are the laughing stock of the world!
1000151354701213696 Senator Schumer and Obama Administration let phone company ZTE flourish with no security checks. I closed it down then let it reopen with high level security guarantees, change of management and board, must purchase U.S. parts and pay a $1.3 Billion fine. Dems do nothing....
1000145873274359809 Funny to watch the Democrats criticize Trade Deals being negotiated by me when they don't even know what the deals are and when for 8 years the Obama Administration did NOTHING on trade except let other countries rip off the United States. Lost almost $800 Billion/year under O
1000138164923781121 Chicago Police have every right to legally protest against the mayor and an administration that just won't let them do their job. The killings are at a record pace and tough police work, which Chicago will not allow, would bring things back to order fast...the killings must stop!
1000114139136606209 To the @NavalAcademy Class of 2018, I say: We know you are up to the task. We know you will make us proud. We know that glory will be yours. Because you are WINNERS, you are WARRIORS, you are FIGHTERS, you are CHAMPIONS, and YOU will lead us to VICTORY! God Bless the U.S.A.!
1000064605903876096 On behalf of the American People, CONGRATULATIONS! We love you!
1000061992042975232 Today, it was my great honor to deliver the 2018 Commencement Address at the United States @NavalAcademy in Annapolis, Maryland. Congratulations! Good luck. Godspeed. And ANCHORS AWEIGH!
999986971660423170 Very good news to receive the warm and productive statement from North Korea. We will soon see where it will lead, hopefully to long and enduring prosperity and peace. Only time (and talent) will tell!
999984507574018049 Democrats are so obviously rooting against us in our negotiations with North Korea. Just like they are coming to the defense of MS 13 thugs, saying that they are individuals & must be nurtured, or asking to end your big Tax Cuts & raise your taxes instead. Dems have lost touch!
999984503123857408 Everyone knows there was a Spy, and in fact the people who were involved in the Spying are admitting that there was a Spy...Widespread Spying involving multiple people. Mollie Hemingway, The Federalist Senior Editor But the corrupt Mainstream Media hates this monster story!
999984495179726848 Can anyone even imagine having Spies placed in a competing campaign, by the people and party in absolute power, for the sole purpose of political advantage and gain? And to think that the party in question, even with the expenditure of far more money, LOST!
999984492197613568 The Democrats are now alluding to the the concept that having an Informant placed in an opposing party's campaign is different than having a Spy, as illegal as that may be. But what about an Informant who is paid a fortune and who sets up way earlier than the Russian Hoax?
999981056387403778 I will be making the Commencment Address today at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. Look forward to being with some of the greatest people on earth!
999761589476655105 Today, it was my great honor to present the #MedalOfHonor to @USNavy (SEAL) Master Chief Special Warfare Operator Britt Slabinski in the East Room of the @WhiteHouse. Full ceremony:
999710267096354819 Today, it was my honor to sign #S2155, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act. Read more:
999695988813189120 I have decided to terminate the planned Summit in Singapore on June 12th. While many things can happen and a great opportunity lies ahead potentially, I believe that this is a tremendous setback for North Korea and indeed a setback for the world...
999687630060118016 It was my great honor to host a roundtable re: MS-13 yesterday in Bethpage, New York. Democrats must abandon their resistance to border security so that we can SUPPORT law enforcement and SAVE innocent lives!
999686062082535424 Sadly, I was forced to cancel the Summit Meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un.
999667181083295744 Sadly, I was forced to cancel the Summit Meeting in Singapore with Kim Jung Un.
999629710370983937 Not surprisingly, the GREAT Men & Women of the FBI are starting to speak out against Comey, McCabe and all of the political corruption and poor leadership found within the top ranks of the FBI. Comey was a terrible and corrupt leader who inflicted great pain on the FBI! #SPYGATE
999626347361206274 Clapper has now admitted that there was Spying in my campaign. Large dollars were paid to the Spy, far beyond normal. Starting to look like one of the biggest political scandals in U.S. history. SPYGATE - a terrible thing!
999454450854039552 Will be interviewed on @foxandfriends tomorrow morning at 6:00 A.M. Enjoy!
999442055670607872 Great to be in New York for the day. Heading back to the @WhiteHouse now, lots of work to be done!
999435250571726848 Thank you to all of the incredible law enforcement officers and firefighters in Bethpage, New York. Keep up the great work!
999373224059265026 Crippling loopholes in our laws have enabled MS-13 gang members and other criminals to infiltrate our communities - and Democrats in Congress REFUSE to close these loopholes, including the disgraceful practice known as Catch-and-Release. Democrats must abandon their resistance...
999371735928582144 Today on Long Island, we were all moved to be joined by families who have suffered unthinkable heartbreak at the hands of MS-13. I was truly honored to be joined again by the courageous families who were my guests at the State of the Union...
999323841351618561 Thank you @SBAList! #SBAGala
999278498182258688 There will be big news coming soon for our great American Autoworkers. After many decades of losing your jobs to other countries, you have waited long enough!
999258232110579714 Big legislation will be signed by me shortly. After many years, RIGHT TO TRY and big changes to DODD FRANK.
999257533327073281 Our Trade Deal with China is moving along nicely, but in the end we will probably have to use a different structure in that this will be too hard to get done and to verify results after completion.
999252093998370817 Trump should be happy that the FBI was SPYING on his campaign No, James Clapper, I am not happy. Spying on a campaign would be illegal, and a scandal to boot!
999249186762772481 Everybody is with Tomi Lahren, a truly outstanding and respected young woman! @foxandfriends
999246677549768704 SPYGATE could be one of the biggest political scandals in history!
999243732506562560 It's clear that they had eyes and ears all over the Trump Campaign Judge Andrew Napolitano
999242039723163648 Look how things have turned around on the Criminal Deep State. They go after Phony Collusion with Russia, a made up Scam, and end up getting caught in a major SPY scandal the likes of which this country may never have seen before! What goes around, comes around!
999239924401438720 @foxandfriends New Bombshell in the Obama Spying Scandal. Did other Agencies SPY on Trump Campaign? Even Clapper, worlds dumbest former Intelligence Head, who has the problem of lying a lot, used the word SPY when describing the illegal activities!
999096013674680321 ...Follow the money! The spy was there early in the campaign and yet never reported Collusion with Russia, because there was no Collusion. He was only there to spy for political reasons and to help Crooked Hillary win - just like they did to Bernie Sanders, who got duped!
999096011174924289 If the person placed very early into my campaign wasn't a SPY put there by the previous Administration for political purposes, how come such a seemingly massive amount of money was paid for services rendered - many times higher than normal...
999087688983764992 For the first time since Roe v. Wade, America has a Pro-Life President, a Pro-Life Vice President, a Pro-Life House of Representatives and 25 Pro-Life Republican State Capitals!
999010902472122368 It was my honor to welcome @NASCAR Cup Series Champion @MartinTruex_Jr and his team to the @WhiteHouse yesterday!
998992271629570048 Today, it was my great honor to welcome President Moon Jae-in of the Republic of Korea to the @WhiteHouse!Ã°Å¸ÂºÃ°Å¸Â¸Ã°Å¸Â°Ã°Å¸Â·
998704493335334912 @AsaHutchinson, the great Governor of Arkansas, is in a primary tomorrow. He has done an incredible job with a focus on lower taxes, border security, and crime prevention. Asa loves our military and our veterans. I fully endorse Asa for Governor!
998553122179084290 Under our potential deal with China, they will purchase from our Great American Farmers practically as much as our Farmers can produce.
998546786628395009 The Wall Street Journal asks, WHERE IN THE WORLD WAS BARACK OBAMA? A very good question!
998537117180588033 ...they then used to start an investigation about Trump. It is that simple. This guy is the genesis of this whole Debacle. This was a Political hit job, this was not an Intelligence Investigation. Brennan has disgraced himself, he's worried about staying out of Jail. Dan Bongino
998534123399663616 ....top of the FBI. Brennan started this entire debacle about President Trump. We now know that Brennan had detailed knowledge of the (phony) Dossier...he knows about the Dossier, he denies knowledge of the Dossier, he briefs the Gang of 8 on the Hill about the Dossier, which....
998532136578748425 John Brennan is panicking. He has disgraced himself, he has disgraced the Country, he has disgraced the entire Intelligence Community. He is the one man who is largely responsible for the destruction of American's faith in the Intelligence Community and in some people at the....
998528928259170305 China must continue to be strong & tight on the Border of North Korea until a deal is made. The word is that recently the Border has become much more porous and more has been filtering in. I want this to happen, and North Korea to be VERY successful, but only after signing!
998526637657546753 On China, Barriers and Tariffs to come down for first time.
998525737593376768 China has agreed to buy massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural Products - would be one of the best things to happen to our farmers in many years!
998524172858019840 I ask Senator Chuck Schumer, why didn't President Obama & the Democrats do something about Trade with China, including Theft of Intellectual Property etc.? They did NOTHING! With that being said, Chuck & I have long agreed on this issue! Fair Trade, plus, with China will happen!
998256454590193665 I hereby demand, and will do so officially tomorrow, that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes - and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration!
998250447394820096 The Witch Hunt finds no Collusion with Russia - so now they're looking at the rest of the World. Oh' great!
998202784683053056 ....and why hasn't the Podesta brother been charged and arrested, like others, after being forced to close down his very large and successful firm? Is it because he is a VERY well connected Democrat working in the Swamp of Washington, D.C.?
998196033153839104 What ever happened to the Server, at the center of so much Corruption, that the Democratic National Committee REFUSED to hand over to the hard charging (except in the case of Democrats) FBI? They broke into homes & offices early in the morning, but were afraid to take the Server?
998194013193822208 Now that the Witch Hunt has given up on Russia and is looking at the rest of the World, they should easily be able to take it into the Mid-Term Elections where they can put some hurt on the Republican Party. Don't worry about Dems FISA Abuse, missing Emails or Fraudulent Dossier!
998191501451628544 ...in the Hillary Clinton Campaign where she deleted 33,000 Emails, got $145,000,000 while Secretary of State, paid McCabes wife $700,000 (and got off the FBI hook along with Terry M) and so much more. Republicans and real Americans should start getting tough on this Scam.
998189366844559360 ....At what point does this soon to be $20,000,000 Witch Hunt, composed of 13 Angry and Heavily Conflicted Democrats and two people who have worked for Obama for 8 years, STOP! They have found no Collussion with Russia, No Obstruction, but they aren't looking at the corruption...
998187672979038208 Things are really getting ridiculous. The Failing and Crooked (but not as Crooked as Hillary Clinton) @nytimes has done a long & boring story indicating that the World's most expensive Witch Hunt has found nothing on Russia & me so now they are looking at the rest of the World!
997951982467014656 If the FBI or DOJ was infiltrating a campaign for the benefit of another campaign, that is a really big deal. Only the release or review of documents that the House Intelligence Committee (also, Senate Judiciary) is asking for can give the conclusive answers. Drain the Swamp!
997909163379449857 Great to have our incredible First Lady back home in the White House. Melania is feeling and doing really well. Thank you for all of your prayers and best wishes!
997908016065368066 Great to have our incredible First Lady back home in the White House. Melanie is feeling and doing really well. Thank you for all of your prayers and best wishes!

997612079375945728 America is blessed with extraordinary energy abundance, including more than 250 years worth of beautiful clean coal. We have ended the war on coal, and will continue to work to promote American energy dominance!
997597940444221440 California finally deserves a great Governor, one who understands borders, crime and lowering taxes. John Cox is the man - he'll be the best Governor you've ever had. I fully endorse John Cox for Governor and look forward to working with him to Make California Great Again!
997577906007298048 Just met with UN Secretary-General AntÃÂ³nio Guterres who is working hard to Make the United Nations Great Again. When the UN does more to solve conflicts around the world, it means the U.S. has less to do and we save money. @NikkiHaley is doing a fantastic job!
997573139663028224 America is a Nation that believes in the power of redemption. America is a Nation that believes in second chances - and America is a Nation that believes that the best is always yet to come! #PrisonReform
997515759281680385 We grieve for the terrible loss of life, and send our support and love to everyone affected by this horrible attack in Texas. To the students, families, teachers and personnel at Santa Fe High School Ã¢ we are with you in this tragic hour, and we will be with you forever...
997493407097524224 School shooting in Texas. Early reports not looking good. God bless all!
997474432443707393 Reports are there was indeed at least one FBI representative implanted, for political purposes, into my campaign for president. It took place very early on, and long before the phony Russia Hoax became a hot Fake News story. If true - all time biggest political scandal!
997471413266247681 Why isn't disgraced FBI official Andrew McCabe being investigated for the $700,000 Crooked Hillary Democrats in Virginia, led by Clinton best friend Terry M (under FBI investigation that they killed) gave to McCabe's wife in her run for office? Then dropped case on Clinton!
997429518867591170 Fake News Media had me calling Immigrants, or Illegal Immigrants, Animals. Wrong! They were begrudgingly forced to withdraw their stories. I referred to MS 13 Gang Members as Animals, a big difference - and so true. Fake News got it purposely wrong, as usual!
997422764909912065 Apparently the DOJ put a Spy in the Trump Campaign. This has never been done before and by any means necessary, they are out to frame Donald Trump for crimes he didn't commit. David Asman @LouDobbs @GreggJarrett Really bad stuff!
997239623268085761 It was my great honor to visit with our HEROES last night at Walter Reed Medical Center. There is nobody like them!
997238932311068674 Tomorrow, the House will vote on a strong Farm Bill, which includes work requirements. We must support our Nation's great farmers!
997233764689498112 Great talk with my friend President Mauricio Macri of Argentina this week. He is doing such a good job for Argentina. I support his vision for transforming his country's economy and unleashing its potential!
997227223638790144 Talking trade with the Vice Premier of the People's Republic of China, Liu He.
997220260259487744 Congratulations to our new CIA Director, Gina Haspel!
997136144465842177 Congrats to the House for passing the VA MISSION Act yesterday. Without this funding our veterans will be forced to stand in never ending lines in order to receive care. Putting politics over our veterans care is UNACCEPTABLE Ã¢ Senate must vote yes on this bill by Memorial Day!
997112687799697408 Despite the disgusting, illegal and unwarranted Witch Hunt, we have had the most successful first 17 month Administration in U.S. history - by far! Sorry to the Fake News Media and Haters, but that's the way it is!
997095653875617792 Wow, word seems to be coming out that the Obama FBI SPIED ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WITH AN EMBEDDED INFORMANT. Andrew McCarthy says, There's probably no doubt that they had at least one confidential informant in the campaign. If so, this is bigger than Watergate!
997083372034936832 Wow, word seems to be coming out that the Obama FBI SPIED ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WITH AN IMBEDDED INFORMANT. Andrew McCarthy says, There's probably no doubt that they had at least one confidential informant in the campaign. If so, this is bigger than Watergate!
997076300476055552 Congratulations America, we are now into the second year of the greatest Witch Hunt in American History...and there is still No Collusion and No Obstruction. The only Collusion was that done by Democrats who were unable to win an Election despite the spending of far more money!
996887371210788864 Gina Haspel is one step closer to leading our brave men and women at the CIA. She is exceptionally qualified and the Senate should confirm her immediately. We need her to keep our great country safe! #ConfirmGina
996822740320575488 ...and voted against the massive Tax Cut Bill. He's also weak on borders and crime. Sadly, our great Military and Vets mean nothing to Bobby Jr. Lou Barletta will win! #MAGA
996822738101825538 Lou Barletta will be a great Senator for Pennsylvania but his opponent, Bob Casey, has been a do-nothing Senator who only shows up at election time. He votes along the Nancy Pelosi, Elizabeth Warren lines, loves sanctuary cities, bad and expensive healthcare...
996810253126787073 Today, it was my great honor to welcome President Mirziyoyev of Uzbekistan to the @WhiteHouse!
996802784090640385 House votes today on Choice/MISSION Act. Who will stand with our Great Vets, caregivers, and Veterans Service Organizations? Must get Choice passed by Memorial Day!
996739376028835840 ...haven't even started yet! The U.S. has very little to give, because it has given so much over the years. China has much to give!
996739374619426816 ...We have not seen China's demands yet, which should be few in that previous U.S. Administrations have done so poorly in negotiating. China has seen our demands. There has been no folding as the media would love people to believe, the meetings...
996739372723638272 The Washington Post and CNN have typically written false stories about our trade negotiations with China. Nothing has happened with ZTE except as it pertains to the larger trade deal. Our country has been losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year with China...
996728397362540545 Congratulations to Deb Fischer. The people of Nebraska have seen what a great job she is doing - and it showed up at the ballot box! #MAGA
996723907867676673 Congratulations to Lou Barletta of Pennsylvania. He will be a great Senator and will represent his people well - like they haven't been represented in many years. Lou is a friend of mine and a special guy, he will very much help MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

996460197005717504 Today is one of the most important and solemn occasions of the year Ã¢ the day we pay tribute to the Law Enforcement Heroes who gave their lives in the line of duty. They made the ultimate sacrifice so that we could live in safety and peace. We stand with our police (HEROES) 100%!
996442654568341505 Nebraska - make sure you get out to the polls and VOTE for Deb Fischer today!
996391840860471296 Can you believe that with all of the made up, unsourced stories I get from the Fake News Media, together with the $10,000,000 Russian Witch Hunt (there is no Collusion), I now have my best Poll Numbers in a year. Much of the Media may be corrupt, but the People truly get it!
996368474556583937 Trade negotiations are continuing with China. They have been making hundreds of billions of dollars a year from the U.S., for many years. Stay tuned!
996366330436648960 Our great First Lady is doing really well. Will be leaving hospital in 2 or 3 days. Thank you for so much love and support!
996135379802755072 Heading over to Walter Reed Medical Center to see our great First Lady, Melania. Successful procedure, she is in good spirits. Thank you to all of the well-wishers!
996129630913482755 The so-called leaks coming out of the White House are a massive over exaggeration put out by the Fake News Media in order to make us look as bad as possible. With that being said, leakers are traitors and cowards, and we will find out who they are!
996119678551552000 ZTE, the large Chinese phone company, buys a big percentage of individual parts from U.S. companies. This is also reflective of the larger trade deal we are negotiating with China and my personal relationship with President Xi.
996021417622851584 Big day for Israel. Congratulations!
995980604016611329 U.S. Embassy opening in Jerusalem will be covered live on @FoxNews & @FoxBusiness. Lead up to 9:00 A.M. (eastern) event has already begun. A great day for Israel!
995816799341088770 So sad to see the Terror Attack in Paris. At some point countries will have to open their eyes & see what is really going on. This kind of sickness & hatred is not compatible with a loving, peaceful, & successful country! Changes to our thought process on terror must be made.
995758467645353985 Remember how badly Iran was behaving with the Iran Deal in place. They were trying to take over the Middle East by whatever means necessary. Now, that will not happen!
995746011321597953 China and the United States are working well together on trade, but past negotiations have been so one sided in favor of China, for so many years, that it is hard for them to make a deal that benefits both countries. But be cool, it will all work out!
995680316458262533 President Xi of China, and I, are working together to give massive Chinese phone company, ZTE, a way to get back into business, fast. Too many jobs in China lost. Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done!
995428472674758656 The Senate should get funding done before the August break, or NOT GO HOME. Wall and Border Security should be included. Also waiting for approval of almost 300 nominations, worst in history. Democrats are doing everything possible to obstruct, all they know how to do. STAY!
995424104286179328 Iran's Military Budget is up more than 40% since the Obama negotiated Nuclear Deal was reached...just another indicator that it was all a big lie. But not anymore!
995410516129538048 North Korea has announced that they will dismantle Nuclear Test Site this month, ahead of the big Summit Meeting on June 12th. Thank you, a very smart and gracious gesture!
995088584221839360 Why doesn't the Fake News Media state that the Trump Administration's Anti-Trust Division has been, and is, opposed to the AT&T purchase of Time Warner in a currently ongoing Trial. Such a disgrace in reporting!
995085901079433219 Big week next week when the American Embassy in Israel will be moved to Jerusalem. Congratulations to all!
995044981768425477 The American people deserve a healthcare system that takes care of them Ã¢ not one that takes advantage of them. We will work every day to ensure all Americans have access to the quality, affordable medication they need and deserve. We will not rest until the job is done!
995023303906652160 Today, my Administration is launching the most sweeping action in history to lower the price of prescription drugs for the American People. We will have tougher negotiation, more competition, and much lower prices at the pharmacy counter!
994741305908649985 Thank you Indiana! #MAGAÃ°Å¸ÂºÃ°Å¸Â¸
994587349718847489 The highly anticipated meeting between Kim Jong Un and myself will take place in Singapore on June 12th. We will both try to make it a very special moment for World Peace!
994586105822564353 Five Most Wanted leaders of ISIS just captured!
994585463380987904 Senator Cryin' Chuck Schumer fought hard against the Bad Iran Deal, even going at it with President Obama, & then Voted AGAINST it! Now he says I should not have terminated the deal - but he doesn't really believe that! Same with Comey. Thought he was terrible until I fired him!
994517833357946882 On behalf of the American people, WELCOME HOME!
994401394441453569 Gina Haspel did a spectacular job today. There is nobody even close to run the CIA!
994346538028675072 Looking forward to greeting the Hostages (no longer) at 2:00 A.M.
994345813064192012 The Failing New York Times criticized Secretary of State Pompeo for being AWOL (missing), when in fact he was flying to North Korea. Fake News, so bad!
994194233111273472 Secretary Pompeo and his guests will be landing at Andrews Air Force Base at 2:00 A.M. in the morning. I will be there to greet them. Very exciting!
994192995737096192 I am pleased to inform you that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in the air and on his way back from North Korea with the 3 wonderful gentlemen that everyone is looking so forward to meeting. They seem to be in good health. Also, good meeting with Kim Jong Un. Date & Place set.
994185337504137216 Congratulations to Mike Dewine on his big win in the Great State of Ohio. He will be a great Governor with a heavy focus on HealthCare and Jobs. His Socialist opponent in November should not do well, a big failure in last job!
994182263960162304 Candace Owens of Turning Point USA is having a big impact on politics in our Country. She represents an ever expanding group of very smart thinkers, and it is wonderful to watch and hear the dialogue going on...so good for our Country!
994179864436596736 The Fake News is working overtime. Just reported that, despite the tremendous success we are having with the economy & all things else, 91% of the Network News about me is negative (Fake). Why do we work so hard in working with the media when it is corrupt? Take away credentials?
994176238846664706 The Republican Party had a great night. Tremendous voter energy and excitement, and all candidates are those who have a great chance of winning in November. The Economy is sooo strong, and with Nancy Pelosi wanting to end the big Tax Cuts and Raise Taxes, why wouldn't we win?
993976643898281984 The Iran Deal is defective at its core. If we do nothing, we know what will happen. In just a short time, the world's leading state sponsor of terror will be on the cusp of acquiring the world's most dangerous weapons....
993926510003277825 Statement on the Iran Nuclear Deal:
993815373190492160 John Kerry can't get over the fact that he had his chance and blew it! Stay away from negotiations John, you are hurting your country!
993813485745295360 I will be speaking to my friend, President Xi of China, this morning at 8:30. The primary topics will be Trade, where good things will happen, and North Korea, where relationships and trust are building.
993810085540491264 Gina Haspel, my highly respected nominee to lead the CIA, is being praised for the fact that she has been, and alway will be, TOUGH ON TERROR! This is a woman who has been a leader wherever she has gone. The CIA wants her to lead them into America's bright and glorious future!
993562242124865536 I will be announcing my decision on the Iran Deal tomorrow from the White House at 2:00pm.
993541175511527425 National Prescription Drug #TakeBackDay numbers are in! Another record broken: nearly 1 MILLION pounds of Rx pills disposed! Let's keep fighting this opioid epidemic, America!
993492804985872385 The United States does not need John Kerry's possibly illegal Shadow Diplomacy on the very badly negotiated Iran Deal. He was the one that created this MESS in the first place!
993484478633922560 Is this Phony Witch Hunt going to go on even longer so it wrongfully impacts the Mid-Term Elections, which is what the Democrats always intended? Republicans better get tough and smart before it is too late!
993483042177118208 Lisa Page, who may hold the record for the most Emails in the shortest period of time (to her Lover, Peter S), and attorney Baker, are out at the FBI as part of the Probers getting caught? Why is Peter S still there? What a total mess. Our Country has to get back to Business!
993476979893723137 Good luck to Ric Grenell, our new Ambassador to Germany. A great and talented guy, he will represent our Country well!
993475610377932801 The Great Revolt by Salena Zito and Brad Todd does much to tell the story of our great Election victory. The Forgotten Men & Women are forgotten no longer!
993455375755173892 The 13 Angry Democrats in charge of the Russian Witch Hunt are starting to find out that there is a Court System in place that actually protects people from injustice...and just wait Ã¢till the Courts get to see your unrevealed Conflicts of Interest!
993452275648679938 The Russia Witch Hunt is rapidly losing credibility. House Intelligence Committee found No Collusion, Coordination or anything else with Russia. So now the Probe says OK, what else is there? How about Obstruction for a made up, phony crime.There is no O, it's called Fighting Back
993446539988217857 My highly respected nominee for CIA Director, Gina Haspel, has come under fire because she was too tough on Terrorists. Think of that, in these very dangerous times, we have the most qualified person, a woman, who Democrats want OUT because she is too tough on terror. Win Gina!
993443781281271808 To the great people of West Virginia we have, together, a really great chance to keep making a big difference. Problem is, Don Blankenship, currently running for Senate, can't win the General Election in your State...No way! Remember Alabama. Vote Rep. Jenkins or A.G. Morrisey!
992880573025865729 Thank you Cleveland, Ohio!
992562394051293186 Our high level delegation is on the way back from China where they had long meetings with Chinese leaders and business representatives. We will be meeting tomorrow to determine the results, but it is hard for China in that they have become very spoiled with U.S. trade wins!
992558888212946949 Just returned home to the beautiful White House, from Dallas, where the Arena was packed to the rafters with the great fans and supporters of the @NRA. It was so wonderful to be there!
992556495182155776 Great book just out by very successful businessman @AndyPuzder. Always known as somebody who knows how to win, Capitalist Comeback will be a big hit!
992538416196804608 I want to thank all of our friends and patriots at the @NRA. We will never fail, and we will always protect your Second Amendment! God Bless you, and God Bless America!
992524132884664321 We are going to demand Congress secure the border in the upcoming CR. Illegal immigration must end!
992523949698412544 Democrats and liberals in Congress want to disarm law-abiding Americans at the same time they are releasing dangerous criminal aliens and savage gang members onto our streets. Politicians who put criminal aliens before American Citizens should be voted out of office!
992503576852393985 All of us here today are united by the same timeless values. We believe that our liberty is a gift from our creator, and that no Government can ever take it away. We believe in the rule of law - and we support the men and women of law enforcement. We have pride in our history...
992395376039727104 JUST OUT: 3.9% Unemployment. 4% is Broken! In the meantime, WITCH HUNT!
992357529362583552 Going to Dallas (the GREAT State of Texas) today. Leaving soon!
992354530510721025 NBC NEWS is wrong again! They cite sources which are constantly wrong. Problem is, like so many others, the sources probably don't exist, they are fabricated, fiction! NBC, my former home with the Apprentice, is now as bad as Fake News CNN. Sad!
992352585863651329 Andy McCarthy will be on @LouDobbs tonight. 7:00 P.M. , @FoxBusiness.
992350362450518016 Because Jobs in the U.S. are doing so well, Americans receiving unemployment aid is the lowest since 1973. Great!
992348740529815552 Our Southern Border is under siege. Congress must act now to change our weak and ineffective immigration laws. Must build a Wall. Mexico, which has a massive crime problem, is doing little to help!
992083738531192833 This spring marks 4yrs since the Phoenix VA crisis. We won't forget what happened to our GREAT VETS. Choice is vital, but the program needs work & is running out of $. Congress must fix Choice Program by Memorial Day so VETS can get the care they deserve. I will sign immediately!
992078098974703616 Today, it was my great honor to celebrate the #NationalDayOfPrayer at the @WhiteHouse, in the Rose Garden! Proclamation:
991995845120753664 ...despite already having signed a detailed letter admitting that there was no affair. Prior to its violation by Ms. Clifford and her attorney, this was a private agreement. Money from the campaign, or campaign contributions, played no roll in this transaction.
991994433750142976 ...very common among celebrities and people of wealth. In this case it is in full force and effect and will be used in Arbitration for damages against Ms. Clifford (Daniels). The agreement was used to stop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair,......
991992302267785216 Mr. Cohen, an attorney, received a monthly retainer, not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign, from which he entered into, through reimbursement, a private contract between two parties, known as a non-disclosure agreement, or NDA. These agreements are.....
991886413686861824 Our great financial team is in China trying to negotiate a level playing field on trade! I look forward to being with President Xi in the not too distant future. We will always have a good (great) relationship!
991884309400342529 Ainsley Earnhardt, a truly great person, just wrote a wonderful book, The Light Within Me, which is doing really well. She is very special and so is her new book...bring it to number one!
991843153953964033 As everybody is aware, the past Administration has long been asking for three hostages to be released from a North Korean Labor camp, but to no avail. Stay tuned!
991809653980966913 This isn't some game. You are screwing with the work of the president of the United States. John Dowd, March 2018. With North Korea, China, the Middle East and so much more, there is not much time to be thinking about this, especially since there was no Russian Collusion.
991776286489169920 I have been briefed on the U.S. C-130 Hercules cargo plane from the Puerto Rico National Guard that crashed near Savannah Hilton Head International Airport. Please join me in thoughts and prayers for the victims, their families and the great men and women of the National Guard.
991690248399794176 A Rigged System - They don't want to turn over Documents to Congress. What are they afraid of? Why so much redacting? Why such unequal justice? At some point I will have no choice but to use the powers granted to the Presidency and get involved!
991672075491438594 NEW BOOK - A MUST READ! The Russia Hoax - The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump by the brilliant Fox News Legal Analyst Gregg Jarrett. A sad chapter for law enforcement. A rigged system!
991669454823141376 The questions are an intrusion into the President's Article 2 powers under the Constitution to fire any Executive Branch Employee...what the President was thinking is an outrageous.....as to the President's unfettered power to fire anyone... Joe Digenova, former US Attorney
991644756995444736 There was no Collusion (it is a Hoax) and there is no Obstruction of Justice (that is a setup & trap). What there is is Negotiations going on with North Korea over Nuclear War, Negotiations going on with China over Trade Deficits, Negotiations on NAFTA, and much more. Witch Hunt!
991402619552845825 Today, it was my great honor to thank and welcome heroic crew members and passengers of Southwest Airlines Flight 1380 at the @WhiteHouse!
991360908868931585 Today I had the great honor of awarding the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy, for the first time in 21 years, to the @ArmyWP_Football Black Knights at the @WhiteHouse. Congratulations!
991337381654654976 Yesterday, it was my great honor to welcome President @MBuhari of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to the @WhiteHouse!Ã°Å¸ÂºÃ°Å¸Â¸Ã°Å¸Â³Ã°Å¸Â¬
991279620044591105 It would seem very hard to obstruct justice for a crime that never happened! Witch Hunt!
991271009570484224 Delegation heading to China to begin talks on the Massive Trade Deficit that has been created with our Country. Very much like North Korea, this should have been fixed years ago, not now. Same with other countries and NAFTA...but it will all get done. Great Potential for USA!
991267863674675200 So disgraceful that the questions concerning the Russian Witch Hunt were leaked to the media. No questions on Collusion. Oh, I see...you have a made up, phony crime, Collusion, that never existed, and an investigation begun with illegally leaked classified information. Nice!
991090373417152515 The White House is running very smoothly despite phony Witch Hunts etc. There is great Energy and unending Stamina, both necessary to get things done. We are accomplishing the unthinkable and setting positive records while doing so! Fake News is going bonkers!
991087278515769345 The Fake News is going crazy making up false stories and using only unnamed sources (who don't exist). They are totally unhinged, and the great success of this Administration is making them do and say things that even they can't believe they are saying. Truly bad people!
991084673697812481 During Small Business Week, we celebrate the great, hard-working entrepreneurs across our country who have started and operate a small business!
991084424992296962 The migrant Ã¢caravan' that is openly defying our border shows how weak & ineffective U.S. immigration laws are. Yet Democrats like Jon Tester continue to support the open borders agenda Ã¢ Tester even voted to protect Sanctuary Cities. We need lawmakers who will put America First.
991028027785138177 I recently had a terrific meeting with a bipartisan group of freshman lawmakers who feel very strongly in favor of Congressional term limits. I gave them my full support and endorsement for their efforts. #DrainTheSwamp
990928644100034561 Numerous countries are being considered for the MEETING, but would Peace House/Freedom House, on the Border of North & South Korea, be a more Representative, Important and Lasting site than a third party country? Just asking!
990926480329859073 The White House Correspondents' Dinner is DEAD as we know it. This was a total disaster and an embarrassment to our great Country and all that it stands for. FAKE NEWS is alive and well and beautifully represented on Saturday night!
990787671281819648 Headline: Kim Prepared to Cede Nuclear Weapons if U.S. Pledges Not to Invade - from the Failing New York Times. Also, will shut down Nuclear Test Site in May.
990782291667488768 The White House Correspondents' Dinner was a failure last year, but this year was an embarrassment to everyone associated with it. The filthy comedian totally bombed (couldn't even deliver her lines-much like the Seth Meyers weak performance). Put Dinner to rest, or start over!
990764965282893827 Trump's Triumphs are driving his critics Crazy! Thank you Steve Hilton @NextRevFNC, just want to do what is right for our wonderful U.S.A.
990559834020962304 Just got recent Poll - much higher than President O at same time....Well, much more has been accomplished!
990557728752926725 While Washington, Michigan, was a big success, Washington, D.C., just didn't work. Everyone is talking about the fact that the White House Correspondents Dinner was a very big, boring bust...the so-called comedian really bombed. @greggutfeld should host next year! @PeteHegseth
990551654952067073 Great evening last night in Washington, Michigan. The enthusiasm, knowledge and love in that room was unreal. To the many thousands of people who couldn't get in, I cherish you....and will be back!
990361469802905600 Join me LIVE in Washington, Michigan at 7:00pmE on @FoxNews! #MAGA
990307626784362496 Secret Service has just informed me that Senator Jon Tester's statements on Admiral Jackson are not true. There were no such findings. A horrible thing that we in D.C. must live with, just like phony Russian Collusion. Tester should lose race in Montana. Very dishonest and sick!
990227703575056384 Look forward to being in the Great State of Michigan tonight. Major business expansion and jobs pouring into your State. Auto companies expanding at record pace. Big crowd tonight, will be live on T.V.
990225456233316354 Just had a long and very good talk with President Moon of South Korea. Things are going very well, time and location of meeting with North Korea is being set. Also spoke to Prime Minister Abe of Japan to inform him of the ongoing negotiations.
990213619190202369 Clapper lied about (fraudulent) Dossier leaks to CNN @foxandfriends FoxNews He is a lying machine who now works for Fake News CNN.
990202926114189312 ....great people of Montana will not stand for this kind of slander when talking of a great human being. Admiral Jackson is the kind of man that those in Montana would most respect and admire, and now, for no reason whatsoever, his reputation has been shattered. Not fair, Tester!
990200773232529413 Allegations made by Senator Jon Tester against Admiral/Doctor Ron Jackson are proving false. The Secret Service is unable to confirm (in fact they deny) any of the phony Democrat charges which have absolutely devastated the wonderful Jackson family. Tester should resign. The.....
990049088375836672 House Intelligence Committee rules that there was NO COLLUSION between the Trump Campaign and Russia. As I have been saying all along, it is all a big Hoax by the Democrats based on payments and lies. There should never have been a Special Counsel appointed. Witch Hunt!
990037854884696064 House Intelligence Committee rules that there was NO COLLUSION between the Trump Campaign and Russia. As I have been saying all along, it is all a big Hoax by the Democrats based on payments and lies. There should never have been a Special Councel appointed. Witch Hunt!
989948140814991360 I urge all Americans to participate in #takebackday tomorrow! Let's come together and BEAT last October's record of disposed prescription pills! Visit to learn more on how to participate Saturday and every day.
989870523042680832 Just Out: House Intelligence Committee Report released. No evidence that the Trump Campaign colluded, coordinated or conspired with Russia. Clinton Campaign paid for Opposition Research obtained from Russia- Wow! A total Witch Hunt! MUST END NOW!
989858791687671808 Look forward to meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany today. So much to discuss, so little time! It will be good for both of our great countries!
989854486310113282 Kanye West has performed a great service to the Black Community - Big things are happening and eyes are being opened for the first time in Decades - Legacy Stuff! Thank you also to Chance and Dr. Darrell Scott, they really get it (lowest Black & Hispanic unemployment in history).
989834048796266498 Please do not forget the great help that my good friend, President Xi of China, has given to the United States, particularly at the Border of North Korea. Without him it would have been a much longer, tougher, process!
989827358961086465 So great to have Staff Sgt. Dan Nevins and the incredible WOUNDED WARRIORS with me in the White House yesterday. These are truly brave and special people! @foxandfriends
989820401596366849 KOREAN WAR TO END! The United States, and all of its GREAT people, should be very proud of what is now taking place in Korea!
989816772713906177 After a furious year of missile launches and Nuclear testing, a historic meeting between North and South Korea is now taking place. Good things are happening, but only time will tell!
989813047773614080 Is everybody believing what is going on. James Comey can't define what a leak is. He illegally leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION but doesn't understand what he did or how serious it is. He lied all over the place to cover it up. He's either very sick or very dumb. Remember sailor!
989650212380692480 The U.S. has put together a STRONG bid w/ Canada & Mexico for the 2026 World Cup. It would be a shame if countries that we always support were to lobby against the U.S. bid. Why should we be supporting these countries when they don't support us (including at the United Nations)?
989629633376194561 Loved being on @foxandfriends this morning. Great show!

989225812166696960 Thank you Kanye, very cool!
989144989690187776 Looking forward to my meeting with Tim Cook of Apple. We will be talking about many things, including how the U.S. has been treated unfairly for many years, by many countries, on trade.
989144622684409856 @FLOTUS did a spectacular job hosting the President of France @EmmanuelMacron and his wife Brigitte. Every detail was done to perfection. The State Dining Room never looked more beautiful, and Washington is abuzz over what an incredible job Melania did.
989134248010502146 Busy day planned. Looking forward to watching President Macron of France address a Joint Session of Congress today. This is a great honor and seldom allowed to be done...he will be GREAT!
989110172495810560 Congratulations to Republican Debbie Lesko on her big win in the Special Election for Arizona House seat. Debbie will do a Great Job! Press is so silent.
988874883990999040 Our two great republics are linked together by the timeless bonds of history, culture, and destiny. We are people who cherish our values, protect our civilization, and recognize the image of God in every human soul.
988859727219187713 Today, @FLOTUS Melania and I were honored to welcome French President @EmmanuelMacron and Mrs. Brigitte Macron to the @WhiteHouse. We look forward to hosting them at tonight's State Dinner, in their honor.
988856839893897222 @JimRenacci has worked so hard on Tax Reductions, Illegal Immigration, the Border and Crime. I need Jim very badly to help our agenda and to keep MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! He will be a fantastic Senator for the Great State of Ohio, and has my full endorsement!

988850347031584768 President Trump Calls the U.S.-France Relationship Ã¢Unbreakable.' History Shows He's Right.
988840512571441152 Arizona, please get out today and vote @DebbieLesko for Congress in #AZ08. Strong on Border, Immigration and Crime. Great on the Military. Time is ticking down - get out and VOTE today. We need Debbie in Congress!
988839027209097217 Americans stand with you and all of Canada, Prime Minister @JustinTrudeau. Our thoughts and prayers are with you all. #TorontoStrong
988820755164139521 Having great meetings and discussions with my friend, President @EmmanuelMacron of France. We are in the midst of meetings on Iran, Syria and Trade. We will be holding a joint press conference shortly, here at the @WhiteHouse. Ã°Å¸ÂºÃ°Å¸Â¸Ã°Å¸Â«Ã°Å¸Â·
988509958089166848 Here's a great stat - since January 2017, the number of people forced to use food stamps is down 1.9 million. The American people are finally back to work!
988415011382091776 Mexico, whose laws on immigration are very tough, must stop people from going through Mexico and into the U.S. We may make this a condition of the new NAFTA Agreement. Our Country cannot accept what is happening! Also, we must get Wall funding fast.
988413372298416128 Despite the Democrat inspired laws on Sanctuary Cities and the Border being so bad and one sided, I have instructed the Secretary of Homeland Security not to let these large Caravans of people into our Country. It is a disgrace. We are the only Country in the World so naive! WALL
988405962624118785 Hard to believe Obstructionists May vote against Mike Pompeo for Secretary of State. The Dems will not approve hundreds of good people, including the Ambassador to Germany. They are maxing out the time on approval process for all, never happened before. Need more Republicans!
988148545545895937 Thank you to the incredible Law Enforcement Officers from the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. They keep us safe and are very cool about it!
988146462625181696 Kim Strassel of the WSJ just said, after reviewing the dumb Comey Memos, you got to ask, what was the purpose of the Special Counsel? There's no there there. Dan Henninger of the WSJ said Memos would show that this would be one of the weakest obstruction cases ever brought!
988126197619068928 Funny how all of the Pundits that couldn't come close to making a deal on North Korea are now all over the place telling me how to make a deal!
988106076028653568 A complete Witch Hunt!
988056354567917568 I can die happy now with Trump Job performance, stated Mary Matalin. A great overall President, stunning! Thank you Mary.
988040227167064064 ....We are a long way from conclusion on North Korea, maybe things will work out, and maybe they won't - only time will tell....But the work I am doing now should have been done a long time ago!
988037292932653056 Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd of Fake News NBC just stated that we have given up so much in our negotiations with North Korea, and they have given up nothing. Wow, we haven't given up anything & they have agreed to denuclearization (so great for World), site closure, & no more testing!
988030312088260608 GOP Lawmakers asking Sessions to Investigate Comey and Hillary Clinton. @FoxNews Good luck with that request!
987820963038449664 At least two Memos Comey shared with a friend contained Classified Information. Wall Street Journal
987786331995672576 The Washington Post said I refer to Jeff Sessions as Mr. Magoo and Rod Rosenstein as Mr. Peepers. This is according to people with whom the president has spoken. There are no such people and don't know these characters...just more Fake & Disgusting News to create ill will!
987774054651301888 James Comey's Memos are Classified, I did not Declassify them. They belong to our Government! Therefore, he broke the law! Additionally, he totally made up many of the things he said I said, and he is already a proven liar and leaker. Where are Memos on Clinton, Lynch & others?
987768453338673152 Sylvester Stallone called me with the story of heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson. His trials and tribulations were great, his life complex and controversial. Others have looked at this over the years, most thought it would be done, but yes, I am considering a Full Pardon!
987766033862873091 So funny, the Democrats have sued the Republicans for Winning. Now he R's counter and force them to turn over a treasure trove of material, including Servers and Emails!
987719560282476546 Heading to the Southern White House to watch the Funeral Service of Barbara Bush. First Lady Melania has arrived in Houston to pay our respects. Will be a beautiful day!
987718953886679047 Today, my thoughts and prayers are with the entire Bush family. In memory of First Lady Barbara Bush, there is a remembrance display located at her portrait in the Center Hall of the @WhiteHouse.
987718832096768001 Fantastic crowd and great people yesterday in Key West, Florida. Thank you!
987682105269391360 Join me in Washington, Michigan on Saturday, April 28, 2018 at 7:00pm! #MAGA Tickets:
987679852345135105 ....it means lying or making up stories. Sorry, I don't see Michael doing that despite the horrible Witch Hunt and the dishonest media!
987679850545778689 ....non-existent sources and a drunk/drugged up loser who hates Michael, a fine person with a wonderful family. Michael is a businessman for his own account/lawyer who I have always liked & respected. Most people will flip if the Government lets them out of trouble, even if....
987679848284999680 The New York Times and a third rate reporter named Maggie Haberman, known as a Crooked H flunkie who I don't speak to and have nothing to do with, are going out of their way to destroy Michael Cohen and his relationship with me in the hope that he will flip. They use....

987666603516063744 ....it means lying or making up stories. Sorry, I don't see Michael doing that despite the horrible Witch Hunt and the dishonest media!
987532088302886913 A message from Kim Jong Un: North Korea will stop nuclear tests and launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles. Also will Shut down a nuclear test site in the country's Northern Side to prove the vow to suspend nuclear tests. Progress being made for all!
987529636656697345 James Comey illegally leaked classified documents to the press in order to generate a Special Council? Therefore, the Special Council was established based on an illegal act? Really, does everybody know what that means?
987470932989050881 Just heard the Campaign was sued by the Obstructionist Democrats. This can be good news in that we will now counter for the DNC Server that they refused to give to the FBI, the Debbie Wasserman Schultz Servers and Documents held by the Pakistani mystery man and Clinton Emails.
987463564305797126 North Korea has agreed to suspend all Nuclear Tests and close up a major test site. This is very good news for North Korea and the World - big progress! Look forward to our Summit.
987459505855369221 Just heard the Campaign was sued by the Obstructionist Democrats. This can be good news in that we will now counter for the DNC Server that they refused to give to the FBI, the Wendy Wasserman Schultz Servers and Documents held by the Pakistani mystery man and Clinton Emails.
987426984195174405 Can you believe that despite 93% bad stories from the Fake News Media (should be getting good stories), today we had just about our highest Poll Numbers, including those on Election Day? The American public is wise to the phony an dishonest press. Make America Great Again!
987284041304100864 Looks like OPEC is at it again. With record amounts of Oil all over the place, including the fully loaded ships at sea, Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted!
987282387196436480 Nancy Pelosi is going absolutely crazy about the big Tax Cuts given to the American People by the Republicans...got not one Democrat Vote! Here's a choice. They want to end them and raise your taxes substantially. Republicans are working on making them permanent and more cuts!
987280537348866048 So exciting! I have agreed to be the Commencement Speaker at our GREAT Naval Academy on May 25th in Annapolis, Maryland. Looking forward to being there.
987278269765517312 So General Michael Flynn's life can be totally destroyed while Shadey James Comey can Leak and Lie and make lots of money from a third rate book (that should never have been written). Is that really the way life in America is supposed to work? I don't think so!
987173366401585155 James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION. Also, he leaked classified information. WOW! Will the Witch Hunt continue?
987100052710674433 James Comey just threw Andrew McCabe under the bus. Inspector General's Report on McCabe is a disaster for both of them! Getting a little (lot) of their own medicine?
987096152892944389 Sanctuary Cities released at least 142 Gang Members across the United States, making it easy for them to commit all forms of violent crimes where none would have existed. We are doing a great job of law enforcement, but things such as this make safety in America difficult!
987096105841315841 My thoughts, prayers and condolences are with the families, friends and colleagues of the two @GCSOFlorida deputies (HEROES) who lost their lives in the line of duty today.
987066289855303681 Mike Pompeo is outstanding. First in his class at West Point. A top student at Harvard Law School. A success at whatever he has done. We need the Senate to approve Mike ASAP. He will be a great Secretary of State!
987065049566138375 ...Hopefully the Senate will not leave Washington until our Ambassadors, Judges and the people who make Washington work are approved. The Democrats are Obstructing the process and we need these people approved for the good of our Country!
987063604691259393 Democrats are obstructing good (hopefully great) people wanting to give up a big portion of their life to work for our Government, hence, the American People. They are slow walking all of my nominations - hundreds of people. At this rate it would take 9 years for all approvals!
987038167730552832 @MarshaBlackburn is a wonderful woman who has always been there when we have needed her. Great on the Military, Border Security and Crime. Loves and works hard for the people of Tennessee. She has my full endorsement and I will be there to campaign with her!
987036458648199168 THANK YOU #JIATFSouth, @Norad_Northcom, @southcomwatch and @DHSgov. Keep up the GREAT work!
987003860882526208 Just arrived @NASKeyWest! Heading to a briefing with the Joint Interagency Task Force South, NORTHCOM and SOUTHCOM.
986994992177561600 Governor Jerry Brown announced he will deploy up to 400 National Guard Troops to do nothing. The crime rate in California is high enough, and the Federal Government will not be paying for Governor Brown's charade. We need border security and action, not words!
986988633822412800 Thank you San Diego County for defending the rule of law and supporting our lawsuit against California's illegal and unconstitutional 'Sanctuary' policies. California's dangerous policies release violent criminals back into our communities, putting all Americans at risk.
986979039670931458 Great meeting with Prime Minister Abe of Japan, who has just left Florida. Talked in depth about North Korea, Military and Trade. Good things will happen!
986801143014621185 It was my great honor to host my friend @JPN_PMO @AbeShinzo and his delegation at Mar-a-Lago for the past two days. Lots accomplished, thank you! #SuccessÃ°Å¸ÂºÃ°Å¸Â¸Ã°Å¸Â¯Ã°Å¸
986719240240746497 Great working luncheon with U.S. and Japanese Delegations this afternoon!
986711015630036992 Prime Minister @AbeShinzo of Japan and myself this morning building an even deeper and better relationship while playing a quick round of golf at Trump International Golf Club.
986643179452747776 Best wishes to Prime Minister @Netanyahu and all of the people of Israel on the 70th Anniversary of your Great Independence. We have no better friends anywhere. Looking forward to moving our Embassy to Jerusalem next month!
986576502358671361 Slippery James Comey, the worst FBI Director in history, was not fired because of the phony Russia investigation where, by the way, there was NO COLLUSION (except by the Dems)!
986555533535731712 Mike Pompeo met with Kim Jong Un in North Korea last week. Meeting went very smoothly and a good relationship was formed. Details of Summit are being worked out now. Denuclearization will be a great thing for World, but also for North Korea!
986547093610299392 A sketch years later about a nonexistent man. A total con job, playing the Fake News Media for Fools (but they know it)!
986544648477868032 There is a Revolution going on in California. Soooo many Sanctuary areas want OUT of this ridiculous, crime infested & breeding concept. Jerry Brown is trying to back out of the National Guard at the Border, but the people of the State are not happy. Want Security & Safety NOW!
986436520444866560 While Japan and South Korea would like us to go back into TPP, I don't like the deal for the United States. Too many contingencies and no way to get out if it doesn't work. Bilateral deals are far more efficient, profitable and better for OUR workers. Look how bad WTO is to U.S.
986432143189512192 Pastor Andrew Brunson, a fine gentleman and Christian leader in the United States, is on trial and being persecuted in Turkey for no reason. They call him a Spy, but I am more a Spy than he is. Hopefully he will be allowed to come home to his beautiful family where he belongs!
986430856750395392 It is my great honor to host @JPN_PMO @AbeShinzo!
986430103075868672 @FLOTUS Melania and I join the Nation in celebrating the life of Barbara Bush:
986395361815166981 @FLOTUS Melania and I join the Nation in celebrating the life of Barbara Bush:
986378606606737408 States and Cities throughout our Country are being cheated and treated so badly by online retailers. Very unfair to traditional tax paying stores!
986357228306354178 Today's Court decision means that Congress must close loopholes that block the removal of dangerous criminal aliens, including aggravated felons. This is a public safety crisis that can only be fixed by....
986357230219022342 ....Congress Ã¢ House and Senate must quickly pass a legislative fix to ensure violent criminal aliens can be removed from our society. Keep America Safe!
986344953134673922 Welcome Prime Minister Abe!
986303188587425794 Rasmussen just came out at 51% Approval despite the Fake News Media. They were one of the three most accurate on Election Day. Just about the most inaccurate were CNN and ABC News/Washington Post, and they haven't changed (get new pollsters). Much of the media is a Scam!
986301228337508354 Getting ready to meet Prime Minister Abe of Japan, a truly fine gentleman!
986218871991492608 So many people are seeing the benefits of the Tax Cut Bill. Everyone is talking, really nice to see!
986218870506754048 Looks like Jerry Brown and California are not looking for safety and security along their very porous Border. He cannot come to terms for the National Guard to patrol and protect the Border. The high crime rate will only get higher. Much wanted Wall in San Diego already started!
986218867780448261 I am in Florida and looking forward to my meeting with Prime Minister Abe of Japan. Working on Trade and Military Security.
986218862625648640 Employment is up, Taxes are DOWN. Enjoy!
985858100149309441 Russia and China are playing the Currency Devaluation game as the U.S. keeps raising interest rates. Not acceptable!
985856662866202624 Comey drafted the Crooked Hillary exoneration long before he talked to her (lied in Congress to Senator G), then based his decisions on her poll numbers. Disgruntled, he, McCabe, and the others, committed many crimes!
985529299905187840 Just hit 50% in the Rasmussen Poll, much higher than President Obama at same point. With all of the phony stories and Fake News, it's hard to believe! Thank you America, we are doing Great Things.
985504808646971392 Slippery James Comey, a man who always ends up badly and out of whack (he is not smart!), will go down as the WORST FBI Director in history, by far!
985502053345751040 Attorney Client privilege is now a thing of the past. I have many (too many!) lawyers and they are probably wondering when their offices, and even homes, are going to be raided with everything, including their phones and computers, taken. All lawyers are deflated and concerned!
985496023555608576 I never asked Comey for Personal Loyalty. I hardly even knew this guy. Just another of his many lies. His memos are self serving and FAKE!
985492862958698497 The Syrian raid was so perfectly carried out, with such precision, that the only way the Fake News Media could demean was by my use of the term Mission Accomplished. I knew they would seize on this but felt it is such a great Military term, it should be brought back. Use often!
985489930343321600 Comey throws AG Lynch under the bus! Why can't we all find out what happened on the tarmac in the back of the plane with Wild Bill and Lynch? Was she promised a Supreme Court seat, or AG, in order to lay off Hillary. No golf and grandkids talk (give us all a break)!
985487209510948864 The big questions in Comey's badly reviewed book aren't answered like, how come he gave up Classified Information (jail), why did he lie to Congress (jail), why did the DNC refuse to give Server to the FBI (why didn't they TAKE it), why the phony memos, McCabe's $700,000 & more?
985483513704124416 Unbelievably, James Comey states that Polls, where Crooked Hillary was leading, were a factor in the handling (stupidly) of the Clinton Email probe. In other words, he was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win, and he wanted a job. Slimeball!
985133017256660995 So proud of our great Military which will soon be, after the spending of billions of fully approved dollars, the finest that our Country has ever had. There won't be anything, or anyone, even close!
985130802668294144 A perfectly executed strike last night. Thank you to France and the United Kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine Military. Could not have had a better result. Mission Accomplished!
984877999718895616 DOJ just issued the McCabe report - which is a total disaster. He LIED! LIED! LIED! McCabe was totally controlled by Comey - McCabe is Comey!! No collusion, all made up by this den of thieves and lowlifes!
984828878060335109 We are bringing back our factories, we are bringing back our jobs, and we are bringing back those four beautiful words: MADE IN THE USA!
984767560494313472 ....untruthful slime ball who was, as time has proven, a terrible Director of the FBI. His handling of the Crooked Hillary Clinton case, and the events surrounding it, will go down as one of the worst botch jobs of history. It was my great honor to fire James Comey!
984763579210633216 James Comey is a proven LEAKER & LIAR. Virtually everyone in Washington thought he should be fired for the terrible job he did-until he was, in fact, fired. He leaked CLASSIFIED information, for which he should be prosecuted. He lied to Congress under OATH. He is a weak and.....
984759315046322177 Tremendous pressure is building, like never before, for the Border Wall and an end to crime cradling Sanctuary Cities. Started the Wall in San Diego, where the people were pushing really hard to get it. They will soon be protected!
984631073865953280 Would only join TPP if the deal were substantially better than the deal offered to Pres. Obama. We already have BILATERAL deals with six of the eleven nations in TPP, and are working to make a deal with the biggest of those nations, Japan, who has hit us hard on trade for years!
984507430909308929 America's greatest treasure is our people Ã¢ and my Administration HEARS YOUR VOICE and HAS YOUR BACK. We are fighting to give every American a future of dignity, purpose and pride. AMERICAN SPIRIT is back! #TaxCuts
984499517805486082 Thank you to all of the American workers who travelled here today! This event is dedicated to YOU: the hardworking Americans who make this nation run. You love your country, you provide for your family, you have PRIDE in your work and you cherish our GREAT AMERICAN FLAG! #TaxCuts
984479558765350912 Just had an Agricultural Roundtable with memembers of Congress and Governors. I will be making remarks on the large scale TAX CUTS given to American families and workers at 1:45 P.M. from the Rose Garden. Join me live:
984472778035417088 I have agreed with the historically cooperative, disciplined approach that we have engaged in with Robert Mueller (Unlike the Clintons!). I have full confidence in Ty Cobb, my Special Counsel, and have been fully advised throughout each phase of this process.
984471933050937344 On Yom HaShoah we remember the six million Jews slaughtered in the Holocaust. With each passing year, our duty to remember this atrocity increases as we pledge #NeverAgain. #HolocaustRemembranceDay
984379918682394624 Good luck to Mike Pompeo during his Confirmation Hearing today. He will be a great Secretary of State!
984374422587965440 Never said when an attack on Syria would take place. Could be very soon or not so soon at all! In any event, the United States, under my Administration, has done a great job of ridding the region of ISIS. Where is our Thank you America?
984372760230154241 California Governor Jerry Brown is doing the right thing and sending the National Guard to the Border. Thank you Jerry, good move for the safety of our Country!
984371491277099010 If I wanted to fire Robert Mueller in December, as reported by the Failing New York Times, I would have fired him. Just more Fake News from a biased newspaper!
984231791103012864 Big show tonight on @seanhannity! 9:00 P.M. on @FoxNews
984204373105442816 Honored to have Republican Congressional Leadership join me at the @WhiteHouse this evening. Lots to discuss as we continue MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
984155907251687424 Trump just took a giant step towards actual welfare reform
984095671262367744 The @WhiteHouse is partnering with @Interior and @NatlParkService to bring the @NSCsafety's Prescribed to Death Opioid Memorial to the Ellipse - beginning tomorrow, April 12th to April 18th. More information:
984066131303583746 Speaker Paul Ryan is a truly good man, and while he will not be seeking re-election, he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question. We are with you Paul!
984053549742067712 Much of the bad blood with Russia is caused by the Fake & Corrupt Russia Investigation, headed up by the all Democrat loyalists, or people that worked for Obama. Mueller is most conflicted of all (except Rosenstein who signed FISA & Comey letter). No Collusion, so they go crazy!
984032798821568513 Our relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been, and that includes the Cold War. There is no reason for this. Russia needs us to help with their economy, something that would be very easy to do, and we need all nations to work together. Stop the arms race?
984022625440747520 Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria. Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and smart! You shouldn't be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!
984020136255541248 ....doing things that nobody thought possible, despite the never ending and corrupt Russia Investigation, which takes tremendous time and focus. No Collusion or Obstruction (other than I fight back), so now they do the Unthinkable, and RAID a lawyers office for information! BAD!
984017894240604161 So much Fake News about what is going on in the White House. Very calm and calculated with a big focus on open and fair trade with China, the coming North Korea meeting and, of course, the vicious gas attack in Syria. Feels great to have Bolton & Larry K on board. I (we) are
984015782521835521 The Failing New York Times wrote another phony story. It was political pundit Doug Schoen, not a Ukrainian businessman, who asked me to do a short speech by phone (Skype), hosted by Doug, in Ukraine. I was very positive about Ukraine-another negative to the Fake Russia C story!
983824424532144128 Today, it was my great honor to welcome the 2017 NCAA Football National Champion, Alabama Crimson Tide - to the White House. Congratulations! #RollTide

983698762760704000 Last night, it was my great honor to host America's senior defense and military leaders for dinner at the White House. America's military is the GREATEST fighting force in the history of the world. They all have my pledge of unwavering commitment to our men and women in uniform!
983662953894436864 A TOTAL WITCH HUNT!!!

983423715332558848 The Democrats are not doing what's right for our country. I will not rest until we have secured our borders and restored the rule of law!
983284198046826496 When a car is sent to the United States from China, there is a Tariff to be paid of 2 1/2%. When a car is sent to China from the United States, there is a Tariff to be paid of 25%. Does that sound like free or fair trade. No, it sounds like STUPID TRADE - going on for years!
983143317889323008 Congratulations to Patrick Reed on his great and courageous MASTERS win! When Patrick had his amazing win at Doral 5 years ago, people saw his great talent, and a bright future ahead. Now he is the Masters Champion!
982969547283161090 If President Obama had crossed his stated Red Line In The Sand, the Syrian disaster would have ended long ago! Animal Assad would have been history!
982967389028569088 ....to pay. Open area immediately for medical help and verification. Another humanitarian disaster for no reason whatsoever. SICK!
982966315467116544 Many dead, including women and children, in mindless CHEMICAL attack in Syria. Area of atrocity is in lockdown and encircled by Syrian Army, making it completely inaccessible to outside world. President Putin, Russia and Iran are responsible for backing Animal Assad. Big price...
982954355509907457 President Xi and I will always be friends, no matter what happens with our dispute on trade. China will take down its Trade Barriers because it is the right thing to do. Taxes will become Reciprocal & a deal will be made on Intellectual Property. Great future for both countries!
982950739441004544 The Washington Post is far more fiction than fact. Story after story is made up garbage - more like a poorly written novel than good reporting. Always quoting sources (not names), many of which don't exist. Story on John Kelly isn't true, just another hit job!
982947260005781505 The Washington Post is far more fiction than fact. Story after story is made up made garbage - more like a poorly written novel than good reporting. Always quoting sources (not names), many of which don't exist. Story on John Kelly isn't true...just another hit job!
982943088330108928 The FBI closed the case on Hillary, which was a rigged investigation. They exonerated her even before they ever interviewed her, they never even put her under oath..... and much more. So true Jesse! @WattersWorld
982770847046922240 While Security spending was somewhat more than his predecessor, Scott Pruitt has received death threats because of his bold actions at EPA. Record clean Air & Water while saving USA Billions of Dollars. Rent was about market rate, travel expenses OK. Scott is doing a great job!
982750459877380096 Fire at Trump Tower is out. Very confined (well built building). Firemen (and women) did a great job. THANK YOU!
982724858743328777 What does the Department of Justice and FBI have to hide? Why aren't they giving the strongly requested documents (unredacted) to the HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE? Stalling, but for what reason? Not looking good!
982722926305832960 Lawmakers of the House Judiciary Committee are angrily accusing the Department of Justice of missing the Thursday Deadline for turning over UNREDACTED Documents relating to FISA abuse, FBI, Comey, Lynch, McCabe, Clinton Emails and much more. Slow walking - what is going on? BAD!
982682227581636608 We are sealing up our Southern Border. The people of our great country want Safety and Security. The Dems have been a disaster on this very important issue!
982680387116781568 The United States hasn't had a Trade Surplus with China in 40 years. They must end unfair trade, take down barriers and charge only Reciprocal Tariffs. The U.S. is losing $500 Billion a year, and has been losing Billions of Dollars for decades. Cannot continue!
982673223719489536 Just spoke to @JustinTrudeau to pay my highest respect and condolences to the families of the terrible Humboldt Team tragedy. May God be with them all!
982353975595929600 Congratulations to @bernieandsid on their new @77wabcradio morning radio show in New York City. It was an honor to join you two Ã¢ good luck!

982292963492413442 AMERICA IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS!
982268230306709509 Do you believe that the Fake News Media is pushing hard on a story that I am going to replace A.G. Jeff Sessions with EPA Chief Scott Pruitt, who is doing a great job but is TOTALLY under siege? Do people really believe this stuff? So much of the media is dishonest and corrupt!
982264844136017921 China, which is a great economic power, is considered a Developing Nation within the World Trade Organization. They therefore get tremendous perks and advantages, especially over the U.S. Does anybody think this is fair. We were badly represented. The WTO is unfair to U.S.
982214297160839173 Despite the Aluminum Tariffs, Aluminum prices are DOWN 4%. People are surprised, I'm not! Lots of money coming into U.S. coffers and Jobs, Jobs, Jobs!
981992052786425856 Thank you @WVGovernor Jim Justice. It was my great honor to be with the amazing people of West Virginia today! #MAGA
981987882712883200 Thanks to our historic TAX CUTS, America is open for business, and millions of American workers are seeing more take-home pay through higher wages, salaries and bonuses!
981881669593559040 The Fake News Washington Post, Amazon's chief lobbyist, has another (of many) phony headlines, Trump Defiant As China Adds Trade Penalties. WRONG! Should read, Trump Defiant as U.S. Adds Trade Penalties, Will End Barriers And Massive I.P. Theft. Typically bad reporting!
981859214380462081 The Caravan is largely broken up thanks to the strong immigration laws of Mexico and their willingness to use them so as not to cause a giant scene at our Border. Because of the Trump Administrations actions, Border crossings are at a still UNACCEPTABLE 46 year low. Stop drugs!
981669823221559302 Still Rising: Rasmussen Poll Shows Donald Trump Approval Ratings Now at 51 Percent
981548354088898560 Today we honor Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. on the 50th anniversary of his assassination. Earlier this year I spoke about Dr. King's legacy of justice and peace, and his impact on uniting Americans. #MLK50 Proclamation:
981544432762802176 Our thoughts and prayers are with the four U.S. Marines from the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing who lost their lives in yesterday's Southern California helicopter crash. We pray for their families, and our great @USMC.
981521901079146499 When you're already $500 Billion DOWN, you can't lose!
981492087328792577 We are not in a trade war with China, that war was lost many years ago by the foolish, or incompetent, people who represented the U.S. Now we have a Trade Deficit of $500 Billion a year, with Intellectual Property Theft of another $300 Billion. We cannot let this continue!
981491439233355776 Our Border Laws are very weak while those of Mexico & Canada are very strong. Congress must change these Obama era, and other, laws NOW! The Democrats stand in our way - they want people to pour into our country unchecked....CRIME! We will be taking strong action today.
981287536520847360 Was just briefed on the shooting at YouTube's HQ in San Bruno, California. Our thoughts and prayers are with everybody involved. Thank you to our phenomenal Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders that are currently on the scene.
981259962717388801 WE WILL PROTECT OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!
981248899166932994 Today, it was my honor to welcome Estonia President @KerstiKaljulaid, Lithuania President @Grybauskaite_LT, and Latvia President @Vejonis to the @WhiteHouse. Congratulations on your 100th anniversaries of independence! #BalticSummit:
981168344924536832 I am right about Amazon costing the United States Post Office massive amounts of money for being their Delivery Boy. Amazon should pay these costs (plus) and not have them bourne by the American Taxpayer. Many billions of dollars. P.O. leaders don't have a clue (or do they?)!
981126375716409344 Thank you to Rasmussen for the honest polling. Just hit 50%, which is higher than Cheatin' Obama at the same time in his Administration.
981123772169191424 Check out the fact that you can't get a job at ratings challenged @CNN unless you state that you are totally anti-Trump? Little Jeff Zuker, whose job is in jeopardy, is not having much fun lately. They should clean up and strengthen CNN and get back to honest reporting!
981121409807155200 The big Caravan of People from Honduras, now coming across Mexico and heading to our Weak Laws Border, had better be stopped before it gets there. Cash cow NAFTA is in play, as is foreign aid to Honduras and the countries that allow this to happen. Congress MUST ACT NOW!
981117684489379840 The Fake News Networks, those that knowingly have a sick and biased AGENDA, are worried about the competition and quality of Sinclair Broadcast. The Fakers at CNN, NBC, ABC & CBS have done so much dishonest reporting that they should only be allowed to get awards for fiction!
980966813843509249 President Trump's approval rate among likely U.S. voters hit 50 percent on Monday, which puts him higher than former President Barack Obama's score at the same point into his first term, according to a new poll. Via: @Anna_Giaritelli @DCExaminer
980964100502118400 39% of my nominations, including Diplomats to foreign lands, have not been confirmed due to Democrat obstruction and delay. At this rate, it would take more than 7 years before I am allowed to have these great people start working. Never happened before. Disgraceful!
980961086546632705 Honduras, Mexico and many other countries that the U.S. is very generous to, sends many of their people to our country through our WEAK IMMIGRATION POLICIES. Caravans are heading here. Must pass tough laws and build the WALL. Democrats allow open borders, drugs and crime!
980958298445885446 As ridiculous as it sounds, the laws of our country do not easily allow us to send those crossing our Southern Border back where they came from. A whole big wasted procedure must take place. Mexico & Canada have tough immigration laws, whereas ours are an Obama joke. ACT CONGRESS
980846943130746881 President Donald J. Trump Proclaims April 2, 2018, World Autism Awareness Day
980832496005844993 An honor to host the Annual @WhiteHouse Easter Egg Roll!
980806557846863872 So sad that the Department of Justice and the FBI are slow walking, or even not giving, the unredacted documents requested by Congress. An embarrassment to our country!
980800783313702918 Only fools, or worse, are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon. THEY LOSE A FORTUNE, and this will be changed. Also, our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the country...not a level playing field!
980799183425802240 So funny to watch Fake News Networks, among the most dishonest groups of people I have ever dealt with, criticize Sinclair Broadcasting for being biased. Sinclair is far superior to CNN and even more Fake NBC, which is a total joke.
980794173279342592 Mexico is making a fortune on NAFTA...They have very strong border laws - ours are pathetic. With all of the money they make from the U.S., hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours, at least until Congress changes our immigration laws!
980766121983987712 DACA is dead because the Democrats didn't care or act, and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA bandwagon... No longer works. Must build Wall and secure our borders with proper Border legislation. Democrats want No Borders, hence drugs and crime!
980764358530789380 ...Congress must immediately pass Border Legislation, use Nuclear Option if necessary, to stop the massive inflow of Drugs and People. Border Patrol Agents (and ICE) are GREAT, but the weak Dem laws don't allow them to do their job. Act now Congress, our country is being stolen!
980762392303980544 Mexico has the absolute power not to let these large Caravans of people enter their country. They must stop them at their Northern Border, which they can do because their border laws work, not allow them to pass through into our country, which has no effective border laws.....
980451798606602241 These big flows of people are all trying to take advantage of DACA. They want in on the act!
980451155548491777 Mexico is doing very little, if not NOTHING, at stopping people from flowing into Mexico through their Southern Border, and then into the U.S. They laugh at our dumb immigration laws. They must stop the big drug and people flows, or I will stop their cash cow, NAFTA. NEED WALL!
980443810529533952 Border Patrol Agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the Border because of ridiculous liberal (Democrat) laws like Catch & Release. Getting more dangerous. Caravans coming. Republicans must go to Nuclear Option to pass tough laws NOW. NO MORE DACA DEAL!
980065427375128576 Governor Jerry Moonbeam Brown pardoned 5 criminal illegal aliens whose crimes include (1) Kidnapping and Robbery (2) Badly beating wife and threatening a crime with intent to terrorize (3) Dealing drugs. Is this really what the great people of California want? @FoxNews
980065419632566272 ...does not include the Fake Washington Post, which is used as a lobbyist and should so REGISTER. If the P.O. increased its parcel rates, Amazon's shipping costs would rise by $2.6 Billion. This Post Office scam must stop. Amazon must pay real costs (and taxes) now!
980063581592047617 While we are on the subject, it is reported that the U.S. Post Office will lose $1.50 on average for each package it delivers for Amazon. That amounts to Billions of Dollars. The Failing N.Y. Times reports that the size of the company's lobbying staff has ballooned, and that...
979449770640015361 Washington spent trillions building up foreign countries while allowing OUR OWN infrastructure to fall into a state of total disrepair. No more! It's time to REBUILD, and we will do it with American WORKERS, American GRIT, and American PRIDE!
979447750529110017 JOBS, JOBS, JOBS! Unemployment claims have fallen to a 45-year low. Together, we are making the economy great again!
979444104923840513 We are going to REBUILD our crumbling infrastructure, and there is no better place to begin this campaign than in the Great State of Ohio. A tremendous honor to be here today at a state-of-the-art training site, where the skills of the American Worker are forged and refined!
979326715272065024 I have stated my concerns with Amazon long before the Election. Unlike others, they pay little or no taxes to state & local governments, use our Postal System as their Delivery Boy (causing tremendous loss to the U.S.), and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business!
979108846408003584 ....In the interim, Hon. Robert Wilkie of DOD will serve as Acting Secretary. I am thankful for Dr. David Shulkin's service to our country and to our GREAT VETERANS!

979028987858112512 @USTradeRep just announced an agreement in principle with South Korea on KORUS! A great deal for American and Korean workers. Let's now focus on our important security relationship.
978938860582440960 Received message last night from XI JINPING of China that his meeting with KIM JONG UN went very well and that KIM looks forward to his meeting with me. In the meantime, and unfortunately, maximum sanctions and pressure must be maintained at all cost!
978936058795757568 For years and through many administrations, everyone said that peace and the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was not even a small possibility. Now there is a good chance that Kim Jong Un will do what is right for his people and for humanity. Look forward to our meeting!
978932860307505153 THE SECOND AMENDMENT WILL NEVER BE REPEALED! As much as Democrats would like to see this happen, and despite the words yesterday of former Supreme Court Justice Stevens, NO WAY. We need more Republicans in 2018 and must ALWAYS hold the Supreme Court!
978701966456082433 I am very pleased to welcome the opioid memorial to the President's Park in April. I encourage all to visit and remember those who we have lost to this deadly epidemic. We will keep fighting until we defeat the opioid crisis!
978432632273948674 Trade talks going on with numerous countries that, for many years, have not treated the United States fairly. In the end, all will be happy!
978249938743234560 So much Fake News. Never been more voluminous or more inaccurate. But through it all, our country is doing great!
978226474485534720 The economy is looking really good. It has been many years that we have seen these kind of numbers. The underlying strength of companies has perhaps never been better.
978110975428657153 @HowieCarrShow just wrote a book which everyone is talking about. He was a great help. He is a veteran journalist who had a great influence in NH and beyond. He calls it the most amazing political campaign of modern times. The book is called, What Really Happened. Enjoy! #MAGA

977875057572745216 ....lawyer or law firm will take months to get up to speed (if for no other reason than they can bill more), which is unfair to our great country - and I am very happy with my existing team. Besides, there was NO COLLUSION with Russia, except by Crooked Hillary and the Dems!
977872899792089088 Many lawyers and top law firms want to represent me in the Russia case...don't believe the Fake News narrative that it is hard to find a lawyer who wants to take this on. Fame & fortune will NEVER be turned down by a lawyer, though some are conflicted. Problem is that a new......
977858212635594752 Much can be done with the $1.6 Billion given to building and fixing the border wall. It is just a down payment. Work will start immediately. The rest of the money will come - and remember DACA, the Democrats abandoned you (but we will not)!
977855968364171264 Because of the $700 & $716 Billion Dollars gotten to rebuild our Military, many jobs are created and our Military is again rich. Building a great Border Wall, with drugs (poison) and enemy combatants pouring into our Country, is all about National Defense. Build WALL through M!
977850135697911808 France honors a great hero. Officer died after bravely swapping places with hostage in ISIS related terror attack. So much bravery around the world constantly fighting radical Islamic terrorism. Even stronger measures needed, especially at borders!
977585879651966980 Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of the horrible attack in France yesterday, and we grieve the nation's loss. We also condemn the violent actions of the attacker and anyone who would provide him support. We are with you @EmmanuelMacron!
977319371277156352 As a matter of National Security I've signed the Omnibus Spending Bill. I say to Congress: I will NEVER sign another bill like this again. To prevent this omnibus situation from ever happening again, I'm calling on Congress to give me a line-item veto for all govt spending bills!
977286489410240514 Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.
977221676697079808 News conference at the White House concerning the Omnibus Spending Bill. 1:00 P.M.
977166887493799936 I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.
977159683151712258 DACA was abandoned by the Democrats. Very unfair to them! Would have been tied to desperately needed Wall.
977124622285066240 House Intelligence Committee votes to release final report. FINDINGS: (1) No evidence provided of Collusion between Trump Campaign & Russia. (2) The Obama Administrations Post election response was insufficient. (3) Clapper provided inconsistent testimony on media contacts.
976948306927607810 I am pleased to announce that, effective 4/9/18, @AmbJohnBolton will be my new National Security Advisor. I am very thankful for the service of General H.R. McMaster who has done an outstanding job & will always remain my friend. There will be an official contact handover on 4/9.
976914287217258497 My honor Charlie - thank you! #MAGA
976891486510907393 As a candidate, I pledged that if elected I would use every lawful tool to combat unfair trade, protect American workers, and defend our national security. Today, we took another critical step to fulfill that commitment.
976770619424563200 Remember when they were saying, during the campaign, that Donald Trump is giving great speeches and drawing big crowds, but he is spending much less money and not using social media as well as Crooked Hillary's large and highly sophisticated staff. Well, not saying that anymore!
976765417908776963 Crazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy. Actually, he is weak, both mentally and physically, and yet he threatens me, for the second time, with physical assault. He doesn't know me, but he would go down fast and hard, crying all the way. Don't threaten people Joe!
976655903729610752 Democrats refused to take care of DACA. Would have been so easy, but they just didn't care. I had to fight for Military and start of Wall.
976654851684945920 Got $1.6 Billion to start Wall on Southern Border, rest will be forthcoming. Most importantly, got $700 Billion to rebuild our Military, $716 Billion next year...most ever. Had to waste money on Dem giveaways in order to take care of military pay increase and new equipment.
976535330835836929 .....They can help solve problems with North Korea, Syria, Ukraine, ISIS, Iran and even the coming Arms Race. Bush tried to get along, but didn't have the smarts. Obama and Clinton tried, but didn't have the energy or chemistry (remember RESET). PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH!
976532956557737984 I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also). The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing.......
976420417090015232 Special Council is told to find crimes, whether a crime exists or not. I was opposed to the selection of Mueller to be Special Council. I am still opposed to it. I think President Trump was right when he said there never should have been a Special Council appointed because.....
976415945714556928 ...there was no probable cause for believing that there was any crime, collusion or otherwise, or obstruction of justice! So stated by Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz.
976413956293226496 Special Council is told to find crimes, wether crimes exist or not. I was opposed the the selection of Mueller to be Special Council, I still am opposed to it. I think President Trump was right when he said there never should have been a Special Council appointed because.....
976411208717950976 Department of Justice should have urged the Supreme Court to at least hear the Drivers License case on illegal immigrants in Arizona. I agree with @LouDobbs. Should have sought review.

975720503997620224 A total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest!
975707627182219266 @seanhannity on @foxandfriends now! Great! 8:18 A.M.
975350027169206273 Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!
975346628113596417 Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me. I don't believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?
975341676297445377 Wow, watch Comey lie under oath to Senator G when asked have you ever been an anonymous source...or known someone else to be an anonymous source...? He said strongly never, no. He lied as shown clearly on @foxandfriends.
975163071361683456 The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime. It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC, and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign. WITCH HUNT!
975062797162811394 The Fake News is beside themselves that McCabe was caught, called out and fired. How many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wife's campaign by Crooked H friend, Terry M, who was also under investigation? How many lies? How many leaks? Comey knew it all, and much more!
975057131136274432 As the House Intelligence Committee has concluded, there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump Campaign. As many are now finding out, however, there was tremendous leaking, lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI, Justice & State. #DrainTheSwamp
974859881827258369 Andrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - A great day for Democracy. Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choirboy. He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!

974683485322596352 It would be great for the Republican Party of Nevada, and it's unity if good guy Danny Tarkanian would run for Congress and Dean Heller, who is doing a really good job, could run for Senate unopposed!
974656757187440640 Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and loved ones of the brave troops lost in the helicopter crash on the Iraq-Syria border yesterday. Their sacrifice in service to our country will never be forgotten.

974276383051583488 We do have a Trade Deficit with Canada, as we do with almost all countries (some of them massive). P.M. Justin Trudeau of Canada, a very good guy, doesn't like saying that Canada has a Surplus vs. the U.S.(negotiating), but they do...they almost all do...and that's how I know!
974241711315709954 Larry Kudlow will be my Chief Economic Advisor as Director of the National Economic Council. Our Country will have many years of Great Economic & Financial Success, with low taxes, unparalleled innovation, fair trade and an ever expanding labor force leading the way! #MAGA

974069957905428481 It was wonderful to be back in Missouri where our push for historic TAX CUTS all began. Six months ago I promised that we would cut taxes to bring Main Street roaring back - and that is exactly what is happening!
974051595834003457 Together, we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
974033924493111296 Today the House took major steps toward securing our schools by passing the STOP School Violence Act. We must put the safety of America's children FIRST by improving training and by giving schools and law enforcement better tools. A tragedy like Parkland can't happen ever again!
974032596563832832 Thank you for hosting! #MAGA
973931154796457984 We cannot keep a blind eye to the rampant unfair trade practices against our Country!
973920392543793154 Five of our incredible @Cabinet Secretaries are testifying on the Hill this morning on the need to rebuild our Nation's crumbling infrastructure. We need to build FAST & we need to build for our FUTURE. Thank you @SenateCommerce for hosting this hearing! #InfrastructureInAmerica
973909651065528320 Perhaps at no time in history have the business fundamentals of U.S. companies been better than they are today!
973907142649397251 Hundreds of good people, including very important Ambassadors and Judges, are being blocked and/or slow walked by the Democrats in the Senate. Many important positions in Government are unfilled because of this obstruction. Worst in U.S. history!
973719038982479872 All across this nation, we pray for our country and we THANK GOD for our United States Marines! Thank you. God Bless You. And God Bless America!
973716838889660416 It was my great honor to deliver a message at the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar to our GREAT U.S. Military, straight from the heart of the American People: We support you, we thank you, we love you - and we will always have your back!
973709151510528000 It was my great honor to deliver a message at the Marine Core Air Station Miramar to our GREAT U.S. Military, straight from the heart of the American People: We support you, we thank you, we love you - and we will always have your back!
973685997312491521 If we don't have a wall system, we're not going to have a country. Congress must fund the BORDER WALL & prohibit grants to sanctuary jurisdictions that threaten the security of our country & the people of our country. We must enforce our laws & protect our people! #BuildTheWall
973581274215473153 California's sanctuary policies are illegal and unconstitutional and put the safety and security of our entire nation at risk. Thousands of dangerous & violent criminal aliens are released as a result of sanctuary policies, set free to prey on innocent Americans. THIS MUST STOP!
973580538358374402 According to the Center for Immigration Studies, the $18 billion wall will pay for itself by curbing the importation of crime, drugs and illegal immigrants who tend to go on the federal dole...
973568677189595136 Heading to see the BORDER WALL prototypes in California!
973540316656623616 Mike Pompeo, Director of the CIA, will become our new Secretary of State. He will do a fantastic job! Thank you to Rex Tillerson for his service! Gina Haspel will become the new Director of the CIA, and the first woman so chosen. Congratulations to all!
973536164044034048 The Economy is raging, at an all time high, and is set to get even better. Jobs and wages up. Vote for Rick Saccone and keep it going!
973360355790479361 THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE HAS, AFTER A 14 MONTH LONG IN-DEPTH INVESTIGATION, FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION OR COORDINATION BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA TO INFLUENCE THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.
973305935685963776 It was my great honor to welcome the 2017 World Series Champion Houston @Astros to the @WhiteHouse! #HoustonStrong
973207890084401152 The Pittsburgh Post Gazette just endorsed Rick Saccone for Congress. He will be much better for steel and business. Very strong on experience and what our Country needs. Lamb will always vote for Pelosi and Dems....Will raise taxes, weak on Crime and Border.
973199981292216320 If schools are mandated to be gun free zones, violence and danger are given an open invitation to enter. Almost all school shootings are in gun free zones. Cowards will only go where there is no deterrent!
973187513731944448 ....On 18 to 21 Age Limits, watching court cases and rulings before acting. States are making this decision. Things are moving rapidly on this, but not much political support (to put it mildly).
973185831547670529 Very strong improvement and strengthening of background checks will be fully backed by White House. Legislation moving forward. Bump Stocks will soon be out. Highly trained expert teachers will be allowed to conceal carry, subject to State Law. Armed guards OK, deterrent!.......
973171763835228162 Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross will be speaking with representatives of the European Union about eliminating the large Tariffs and Barriers they use against the U.S.A. Not fair to our farmers and manufacturers.
972853747750711296 Rasmussen and others have my approval ratings at around 50%, which is higher than Obama, and yet the political pundits love saying my approval ratings are somewhat low. They know they are lying when they say it. Turn off the show - FAKE NEWS!
972846978823610369 The Democrats continue to Obstruct the confirmation of hundreds of good and talented people who are needed to run our government...A record in U.S. history. State Department, Ambassadors and many others are being slow walked. Senate must approve NOW!
972835128056664066 The Republicans are 5-0 in recent Congressional races, a point which the Fake News Media continuously fails to mention. I backed and campaigned for all of the winners. They give me credit for one. Hopefully, Rick Saccone will be another big win on Tuesday.
972832210222043137 ...have shown conclusively that there was no Collusion with Russia..just excuse for losing. The only Collusion was that done by the DNC, the Democrats and Crooked Hillary. The writer of the story, Maggie Haberman, a Hillary flunky, knows nothing about me and is not given access.
972829763067883523 The Failing New York Times purposely wrote a false story stating that I am unhappy with my legal team on the Russia case and am going to add another lawyer to help out. Wrong. I am VERY happy with my lawyers, John Dowd, Ty Cobb and Jay Sekulow. They are doing a great job and.....
972647673944780802 Epic crowd in Moon Township, Pennsylvania tonight. Thank you! Get out on Tuesday and VOTE for Rick @Saccone4PA18. Together, we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
972622325454659585 Join me LIVE in Moon Township, Pennsylvania at 7:00pmE. Great crowd for a #MAGA rally!
972585290857672704 The European Union, wonderful countries who treat the U.S. very badly on trade, are complaining about the tariffs on Steel & Aluminum. If they drop their horrific barriers & tariffs on U.S. products going in, we will likewise drop ours. Big Deficit. If not, we Tax Cars etc. FAIR!
972563247160274947 In the first hours after hearing that North Korea's leader wanted to meet with me to talk denuclearization and that missile launches will end, the press was startled & amazed.They couldn't believe it. But by the following morning the news became FAKE.They said so what, who cares!
972542173030879233 North Korea has not conducted a Missile Test since November 28, 2017 and has promised not to do so through our meetings. I believe they will honor that commitment!
972538115901607937 Heading to Moon Township, Pennsylvania, to be with a really good person, State Representative Rick Saccone, who is running for Congress. Big & happy crowd (why not, some of the best economic numbers ever). Rick will help me a lot. Also, tough on crime & border. Loves 2nd A & VETS
972523294233710593 Spoke to Prime Minister Abe of Japan, who is very enthusiastic about talks with North Korea. Also discussing opening up Japan to much better trade with the U.S. Currently have a massive $100 Billion Trade Deficit. Not fair or sustainable. It will all work out!
972506194978983937 Chinese President XI JINPING and I spoke at length about the meeting with KIM JONG UN of North Korea. President XI told me he appreciates that the U.S. is working to solve the problem diplomatically rather than going with the ominous alternative. China continues to be helpful!
972500344197566465 Congratulations to Kristian Saucier, a man who has served proudly in the Navy, on your newly found Freedom. Now you can go out and have the life you deserve!
972492834073927680 Chinese President XI XINPING and I spoke at length about the meeting with KIM JONG UN of North Korea. President XI told me he appreciates that the U.S. is working to solve the problem diplomatically rather than going with the ominous alternative. China continues to be helpful!
972466816114032640 We are deeply saddened by the tragic situation in Yountville and mourn the loss of three incredible women who cared for our Veterans.
972271520847466498 The deal with North Korea is very much in the making and will be, if completed, a very good one for the World. Time and place to be determined.
972242845636669440 Spoke to PM @TurnbullMalcolm of Australia. He is committed to having a very fair and reciprocal military and trade relationship. Working very quickly on a security agreement so we don't have to impose steel or aluminum tariffs on our ally, the great nation of Australia!
972210637018423301 That's right @RepBost! Thank you for your support in helping put America back to work. It's about JOBS, JOBS, JOBS for our incredible workers and putting AMERICA FIRST!

972151933782974464 JOBS, JOBS, JOBS! #MAGA
971915531346436096 Kim Jong Un talked about denuclearization with the South Korean Representatives, not just a freeze. Also, no missile testing by North Korea during this period of time. Great progress being made but sanctions will remain until an agreement is reached. Meeting being planned!

971812821955735552 First Lady Melania Trump to Present the 2018 International Women of Courage Award
971726862526361603 Looking forward to 3:30 P.M. meeting today at the White House. We have to protect & build our Steel and Aluminum Industries while at the same time showing great flexibility and cooperation toward those that are real friends and treat us fairly on both trade and the military.
971409845453762560 The U.S. is acting swiftly on Intellectual Property theft. We cannot allow this to happen as it has for many years!
971402791930552322 China has been asked to develop a plan for the year of a One Billion Dollar reduction in their massive Trade Deficit with the United States. Our relationship with China has been a very good one, and we look forward to seeing what ideas they come back with. We must act soon!
971349864125788160 From Bush 1 to present, our Country has lost more than 55,000 factories, 6,000,000 manufacturing jobs and accumulated Trade Deficits of more than 12 Trillion Dollars. Last year we had a Trade Deficit of almost 800 Billion Dollars. Bad Policies & Leadership. Must WIN again! #MAGA
971345895223676929 @MarkBurnettTV @RealRomaDowney From Bush 1 to present, our Country has lost more than 55,000 factories, 6,000,000 manufacturing jobs and accumulated Trade Deficits of more than 12 Trillion Dollars. Last year we had a Trade Deficit of almost 800 Billion Dollars. Bad policies & leadership. Must win again! #MAGA
971335759679709185 Great couple, great book!
971186041171439616 Will be making a decision soon on the appointment of new Chief Economic Advisor. Many people wanting the job - will choose wisely!
971025582061424640 Possible progress being made in talks with North Korea. For the first time in many years, a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned. The World is watching and waiting! May be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction!
971019306388611073 Federal Judge in Maryland has just ruled that President Trump has the right to end DACA. President Obama had 8 years to fix this problem, and didn't. I am waiting for the Dems, they are running for the hills!
971013841395027968 Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY. Problem is, we don't have Stars anymore - except your President (just kidding, of course)!
971008891751485440 We will see what happens!
971008238673068038 We are getting it done - jobs and security!
971007733313961984 Total inaction on DACA by Dems. Where are you? A deal can be made!
971006379375972354 The new Fake News narrative is that there is CHAOS in the White House. Wrong! People will always come & go, and I want strong dialogue before making a final decision. I still have some people that I want to change (always seeking perfection). There is no Chaos, only great Energy!
970760324126212096 It's March 5th and the Democrats are nowhere to be found on DACA. Gave them 6 months, they just don't care. Where are they? We are ready to make a deal!
970650759091163137 Why did the Obama Administration start an investigation into the Trump Campaign (with zero proof of wrongdoing) long before the Election in November? Wanted to discredit so Crooked H would win. Unprecedented. Bigger than Watergate! Plus, Obama did NOTHING about Russian meddling.
970644394591309824 To protect our Country we must protect American Steel! #AMERICA FIRST
970628441115643904 ...treat our farmers much better. Highly restrictive. Mexico must do much more on stopping drugs from pouring into the U.S. They have not done what needs to be done. Millions of people addicted and dying.
970626966004162560 We have large trade deficits with Mexico and Canada. NAFTA, which is under renegotiation right now, has been a bad deal for U.S.A. Massive relocation of companies & jobs. Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum will only come off if new & fair NAFTA agreement is signed. Also, Canada must..
970451373681790978 We are on the losing side of almost all trade deals. Our friends and enemies have taken advantage of the U.S. for many years. Our Steel and Aluminum industries are dead. Sorry, it's time for a change! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
970353692938469377 The Gridiron Dinner last night was great fun. I am accomplishing a lot in Washington and have never had a better time doing something, and especially since this is for the American People!
969994273121820672 If the E.U. wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on U.S. companies doing business there, we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the U.S. They make it impossible for our cars (and more) to sell there. Big trade imbalance!
969991653393039361 The United States has an $800 Billion Dollar Yearly Trade Deficit because of our very stupid trade deals and policies. Our jobs and wealth are being given to other countries that have taken advantage of us for years. They laugh at what fools our leaders have been. No more!
969989251537481730 Mainstream Media in U.S. is being mocked all over the world. They've gone CRAZY!
969939200933056512 Happy National Anthem Day!
969671528991338498 Heading to Billy Graham Funeral. A Special Man!
969660692419657728 REST IN PEACE BILLY GRAHAM!
969572374977839106 When a country Taxes our products coming in at, say, 50%, and we Tax the same product coming into our country at ZERO, not fair or smart. We will soon be starting RECIPROCAL TAXES so that we will charge the same thing as they charge us. $800 Billion Trade Deficit-have no choice!
969558431802806272 We must protect our country and our workers. Our steel industry is in bad shape. IF YOU DON'T HAVE STEEL, YOU DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY!
969532384285687808 Eric, we are all with you and your family! Look forward to seeing you back on T.V.
969529668234829825 Alec Baldwin, whose dying mediocre career was saved by his terrible impersonation of me on SNL, now says playing me was agony. Alec, it was agony for those who were forced to watch. Bring back Darrell Hammond, funnier and a far greater talent!
969525362580484098 When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, don't trade anymore-we win big. It's easy!
969523385016471552 Alex Baldwin, whose dieing mediocre career was saved by his impersonation of me on SNL, now says playing DJT was agony for him. Alex, it was also agony for those who were forced to watch. You were terrible. Bring back Darrell Hammond, much funnier and a far greater talent!
969408165308747777 Good (Great) meeting in the Oval Office tonight with the NRA!
969374909209239552 Manufacturing growing at the fastest pace in almost two decades!
969374597127778304 Jobless claims at a 49 year low!
969324283036971009 Together, we will face this challenge as a national family with conviction, with unity, and with a commitment to love and support our neighbors in times of dire need. Working together, we will defeat this #OpioidEpidemic.
969311530733981698 Consumer Confidence in February Highest Since November 2000
969277822920470530 Manufacturing in U.S. Expands at Fastest Pace Since May 2004
969272683061022721 Unemployment filings are at their lowest level in over 48 years. Great news for workers and JOBS, JOBS, JOBS! #MAGA
969183644756660224 Our Steel and Aluminum industries (and many others) have been decimated by decades of unfair trade and bad policy with countries from around the world. We must not let our country, companies and workers be taken advantage of any longer. We want free, fair and SMART TRADE!
969178931369783296 Many ideas, some good & some not so good, emerged from our bipartisan meeting on school safety yesterday at the White House. Background Checks a big part of conversation. Gun free zones are proven targets of killers. After many years, a Bill should emerge. Respect 2nd Amendment!
968962582374621185 It was an honor to welcome bipartisan members of Congress for a discussion on SAFE schools and SAFE communities. As we continue to mourn the loss of so many precious young lives in Parkland, we are determined to turn our grief into action. Full meeting:
968924154031497226 Today we honor Billy Graham as only three private citizens before him have been honored. We say a prayer for our country: that all across this land, the Lord will raise up men and women like Billy Graham to spread a message of love and hope to every precious child of God.
968917941671612416 Starting at a small Bible School in Florida, Billy Graham soon led a nationwide revival. From a large tent in Los Angeles, to one hundred thousand people in a single day at Yankee Stadium, to more than two million people at Madison Square Garden over sixteen weeks in 1957...
968896168230051850 Today, in the center of this great Chamber lies Billy Graham Ã¢ an Ambassador for Christ who reminded the world of the power of prayer and the gift of God's grace.
968856971075051521 Why is A.G. Jeff Sessions asking the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse. Will take forever, has no prosecutorial power and already late with reports on Comey etc. Isn't the I.G. an Obama guy? Why not use Justice Department lawyers? DISGRACEFUL!
968850364383596545 45 year low on illegal border crossings this year. Ice and Border Patrol Agents are doing a great job for our Country. MS-13 thugs being hit hard.
968825596133478400 I have decided that sections of the Wall that California wants built NOW will not be built until the whole Wall is approved. Big victory yesterday with ruling from the courts that allows us to proceed. OUR COUNTRY MUST HAVE BORDER SECURITY!
968818810005450752 The Heritage Foundation has just stated that 64% of the Trump Agenda is already done, faster than even Ronald Reagan. We're blown away, said Thomas Binion of Heritage, President Trump is very active, very conservative and very effective. Huge volume & spectrum of issues.
968704442110545923 Big legal win today. U.S. judge sided with the Trump Administration and rejected the attempt to stop the government from building a great Border Wall on the Southern Border. Now this important project can go forward!
968702480753315840 Such a beautiful map, thank you!
968621347294318592 @SenatorWicker of Mississippi has been a great supporter and incredible help in getting our massive Tax Cut Bill done and approved. Also big help on cutting regs. I am with him in his re-election all the way!
968620661349470209 Texas LC George P. Bush backed me when it wasn't the politically correct thing to do, and I back him now. Also, AC Sid Miller has been with me from the beginning, he is Trump's Man in Texas. Also support Comptroller Glenn Hegar, and Railroad Commissioner Christi Craddick.
968550893015707649 American consumers are the most confident they've been since 2000....A strong job market is boosting confidence. The unemployment rate has stayed at a 17-year low.
968549117625602054 I want to encourage all of my many Texas friends to vote in the primary for Governor Greg Abbott, Senator Ted Cruz, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, and Attorney General Ken Paxton. They are helping me to Make America Great Again! Vote early or on March 6th.
968467243192537088 We've seen NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION....I have seen nothing, the firing of James Comey and all of the aftermath, that suggests that the President has obstructed justice because he's exercising his power as the President of the U.S. I just don't see it. Judge Ken Starr
968462966864609280 I've been skeptical about the collusion and obstruction claims for the last year. I just don't see the evidence....in terms of the collusion, it's all a bit implausible based on the evidence we have. Jonathan Turley on @FoxNews
968455547094753281 He's got a very good point. Somebody in the Justice Department has a treasure trove of evidence of Mrs. Clinton's criminality at her own hands, or through others, that ought to be investigated. I fully agree with the President on that. @judgenapolitano on @marthamaccallum Show
967564998238142471 I will be interviewed by @JudgeJeanine on @FoxNews at 9:00 P.M. Enjoy!
967563946063523840 Congressman Schiff omitted and distorted key facts @FoxNews So, what else is new. He is a total phony!
967545724362739712 Russians had no compromising information on Donald Trump @FoxNews Of course not, because there is none, and never was. This whole Witch Hunt is an illegal disgrace...and Obama did nothing about Russia!
967539664692350977 Dem Memo: FBI did not disclose who the clients were - the Clinton Campaign and the DNC. Wow!
967538684789739520 The Democrat memo response on government surveillance abuses is a total political and legal BUST. Just confirms all of the terrible things that were done. SO ILLEGAL!
967526110249537542 BIG CPAC STRAW POLL RESULTS: 93% APPROVE OF THE JOB PRESIDENT TRUMP IS DOING (Thank you!). 50% say President Trump should Tweet MORE or SAME (funny!). 79% say Republicans in Congress should do a better job of working with President Trump (starting to happen).
967508938425069568 Dems are no longer talking DACA! Out of sight, out of mind, they say. DACA beneficiaries should not be happy. Nancy Pelosi truly doesn't care about them. Republicans stand ready to make a deal!
967506350283599874 Unemployment claims are at the lowest level since 1973. Much of this has to do with the massive cutting of unnecessary and job killing Regulations!
967493467046899712 Democrat judges have totally redrawn election lines in the great State of Pennsylvania. @FoxNews. This is very unfair to Republicans and to our country as a whole. Must be appealed to the United States Supreme Court ASAP!
967472757025001472 Armed Educators (and trusted people who work within a school) love our students and will protect them. Very smart people. Must be firearms adept & have annual training. Should get yearly bonus. Shootings will not happen again - a big & very inexpensive deterrent. Up to States.
967388904952344577 So true Wayne, and Lowest black unemployment in history!
967168890232082433 Thank you to the great men and women of the United States @SecretService for a job well done!
967146956094083073 Today, @FLOTUS Melania and I were honored to welcome Prime Minister @TurnbullMalcolm and Mrs. Turnbull of Australia to the @WhiteHouse!
967084806726127616 Our nation's motto is IN GOD WE TRUST. This week, our nation lost an incredible leader who devoted his life to helping us understand what those words really mean. We will never forget the historic crowds, the voice, the energy, and the profound faith of Billy Graham! #CPAC2018
967083810981597185 We salute our great American flag, we put our hands on our hearts for the pledge of Allegiance, and we all PROUDLY STAND for the National Anthem. #CPAC2018
967083281974951939 After years of rebuilding OTHER nations, we are finally rebuilding OUR nation - and we are restoring our confidence and our pride! #CPAC2018
967023714268319744 For those of you who are still interested, the Democrats have totally forgotten about DACA. Not a lot of interest on this subject from them!
967023015035797504 My daughter, Ivanka, just arrived in South Korea. We cannot have a better, or smarter, person representing our country.
966998215592677376 MS-13 gang members are being removed by our Great ICE and Border Patrol Agents by the thousands, but these killers come back in from El Salvador, and through Mexico, like water. El Salvador just takes our money, and Mexico must help MORE with this problem. We need The Wall!
966846679784837120 School shooting survivor says he quit @CNN Town Hall after refusing scripted question. @TuckerCarlson. Just like so much of CNN, Fake News. That's why their ratings are so bad! MSNBC may be worse.
966766375292358659 Today, it was my great honor to host a School Safety Roundtable at the @WhiteHouse with State and local leaders, law enforcement officers, and education officials. There is nothing more important than protecting our children. They deserve to be safe, and we will deliver!
966711641378381826 On behalf of an entire Nation, CONGRATULATIONS to the U.S. Women's Hockey Team on winning the GOLD! #GoTeamUSA #Olympics
966687491616059392 Will be meeting with Lawmakers today at 11:30 A.M. to discuss School Safety. Next week it will be with our Nation's Governors. It's been many years of all talk, no action. We'll get it done!
966681883206668289 What many people don't understand, or don't want to understand, is that Wayne, Chris and the folks who work so hard at the @NRA are Great People and Great American Patriots. They love our Country and will do the right thing. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
966662241977360384 I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!
966660169194229761 ....If a potential sicko shooter knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting, the sicko will NEVER attack that school. Cowards won't go there...problem solved. Must be offensive, defense alone won't work!
966657362789568512 ....History shows that a school shooting lasts, on average, 3 minutes. It takes police & first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime. Highly trained, gun adept, teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly, before police arrive. GREAT DETERRENT!
966653833047887874 ....immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions. Highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this. Far more assets at much less cost than guards. A gun free school is a magnet for bad people. ATTACKS WOULD END!
966650397002813440 I never said give teachers guns like was stated on Fake News @CNN & @NBC. What I said was to look at the possibility of giving concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience - only the best. 20% of teachers, a lot, would now be able to
966487844662456320 I will always remember the time I spent today with courageous students, teachers and families. So much love in the midst of so much pain. We must not let them down. We must keep our children safe!!
966420452070559749 @FLOTUS Melania and I join millions of people around the world in mourning the passing of Billy Graham. Our prayers are with his children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and all who worked closely with Reverend Graham in his lifelong ministry.
966377081469882368 Yesterday, it was my great honor to recognize extraordinary Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders, and to award them the the highest possible decoration for bravery by public safety officers, the Medal of Valor. #AmericanHeroes
966321700588711936 Question: If all of the Russian meddling took place during the Obama Administration, right up to January 20th, why aren't they the subject of the investigation? Why didn't Obama do something about the meddling? Why aren't Dem crimes under investigation? Ask Jeff Sessions!
966317112565420033 The GREAT Billy Graham is dead. There was nobody like him! He will be missed by Christians and all religions. A very special man.
966312434100326400 Question: If all of the Russian meddling took place during the Obama Administration, right up to January 20th, why aren't they the subject of the investigation? Why didn't Obama do something about the meddling? Why aren't Dem crimes under investigation? Ask Jeff Session!
966119932793585664 @CNN @MSNBC Whether we are Republican or Democrat, we must now focus on strengthening Background Checks!
966118856874971138 So true, thank you!
966117265426001920 Bad ratings @CNN & @MSNBC got scammed when they covered the anti-Trump Russia rally wall-to-wall. They probably knew it was Fake News but, because it was a rally against me, they pushed it hard anyway. Two really dishonest newscasters, but the public is wise!
966006815745040384 Main Street is BOOMING thanks to our incredible TAX CUT and Reform law. This shows small-business owners are more than just optimistic, they are ready to grow their businesses.
965971586913374208 ....cameras running. Another False Accusation. Why doesn't @washingtonpost report the story of the women taking money to make up stories about me? One had her home mortgage paid off. Only @FoxNews so reported...doesn't fit the Mainstream Media narrative.
965968309358333952 A woman I don't know and, to the best of my knowledge, never met, is on the FRONT PAGE of the Fake News Washington Post saying I kissed her (for two minutes yet) in the lobby of Trump Tower 12 years ago. Never happened! Who would do this in a public space with live security......
965943827931549696 I have been much tougher on Russia than Obama, just look at the facts. Total Fake News!
965937068907073536 Hope Republicans in the Great State of Pennsylvania challenge the new pushed Congressional Map, all the way to the Supreme Court, if necessary. Your Original was correct! Don't let the Dems take elections away from you so that they can raise taxes & waste money!
965935035328155649 Matt Schlapp and CPAC are getting ready for another exciting event. Big difference from those days when President Obama held the White House. You've come a long way Matt!
965932714141650946 Republicans are now leading the Generic Poll, perhaps because of the popular Tax Cuts which the Dems want to take away. Actually, they want to raise you taxes, substantially. Also, they want to do nothing on DACA, R's want to fix!
965930611272712192 ....The President Obama quote just before election. That's because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win and he didn't want to rock the boat. When I easily won the Electoral College, the whole game changed and the Russian excuse became the narrative of the Dems.
965928352614965248 There is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig America's elections, there's no evidence that that has happened in the past or that it will happen this time, and so I'd invite Mr. Trump to stop whining and make his case to get votes. .....
965925223949357056 Thank you to @foxandfriends for the great timeline on all of the failures the Obama Administration had against Russia, including Crimea, Syria and so much more. We are now starting to win again!
965780052167286784 The Faith of Donald Trump, a book just out by David Brody and Scott Lamb, is a very interesting read. Enjoy!
965775382598311937 The U.S. economy is looking very good, in my opinion, even better than anticipated. Companies are pouring back into our country, reversing the long term trend of leaving. The unemployment numbers are looking great, and Regulations & Taxes have been massively Cut! JOBS, JOBS, JOBS
965773283554668544 @MittRomney has announced he is running for the Senate from the wonderful State of Utah. He will make a great Senator and worthy successor to @OrrinHatch, and has my full support and endorsement!
965676314576543744 Obama was President up to, and beyond, the 2016 Election. So why didn't he do something about Russian meddling?
965582280772276224 Have a great, but very reflective, President's Day!
965442990134251520 Just watched a very insecure Oprah Winfrey, who at one point I knew very well, interview a panel of people on 60 Minutes. The questions were biased and slanted, the facts incorrect. Hope Oprah runs so she can be exposed and defeated just like all of the others!
965303158229622785 My great friends from NASCAR are having their big race today, The Daytona 500. Brian France and the France family are special people. Enjoy the race!
965272331978407937 Thank you to KenStarr, former Independent Counsel, Whitewater, for your insight and powerful words on FISA abuse, Russian meddling etc. Really great interview with @MariaBartiromo
965223354633457665 Great Pollster John McLaughlin now has the GOP up in the Generic Congressional Ballot. Big gain over last 4 weeks. I guess people are loving the big Tax Cuts given them by the Republicans, the Cuts the Dems want to take away. We need more Republicans!
965221024496279552 The Fake News of big ratings loser CNN.
965212168449941505 If it was the GOAL of Russia to create discord, disruption and chaos within the U.S. then, with all of the Committee Hearings, Investigations and Party hatred, they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. They are laughing their asses off in Moscow. Get smart America!
965205208191168512 Now that Adam Schiff is starting to blame President Obama for Russian meddling in the election, he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the Democrats, lead by their fearless leader, Crooked Hillary Clinton, lost the 2016 election. But wasn't I a great candidate?
965202556204003328 I never said Russia did not meddle in the election, I said it may be Russia, or China or another country or group, or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer. The Russian hoax was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia - it never did!
965199840471810049 Finally, Liddle' Adam Schiff, the leakin' monster of no control, is now blaming the Obama Administration for Russian meddling in the 2016 Election. He is finally right about something. Obama was President, knew of the threat, and did nothing. Thank you Adam!
965194903142719489 Never gotten over the fact that Obama was able to send $1.7 Billion Dollars in CASH to Iran and nobody in Congress, the FBI or Justice called for an investigation!
965079126829871104 General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H, the DNC and the Dems. Remember the Dirty Dossier, Uranium, Speeches, Emails and the Podesta Company!
965075589274177536 Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter. This is not acceptable. They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign - there is no collusion. Get back to the basics and make us all proud!
965009332042596352 Just like they don't want to solve the DACA problem, why didn't the Democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the House & Senate during the Obama Administration. Because they didn't want to, and now they just talk!
964956781670694912 I have seen all of the Russian ads and I can say very definitively that swaying the election was *NOT* the main goal. Vice President of Facebook Ads
964955496137535488 The Fake News Media never fails. Hard to ignore this fact from the Vice President of Facebook Ads, Rob Goldman!
964949269374529538 Funny how the Fake News Media doesn't want to say that the Russian group was formed in 2014, long before my run for President. Maybe they knew I was going to run even though I didn't know!
964946611502747649 Deputy A.G. Rod Rosenstein stated at the News Conference: There is no allegation in the indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity. There is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election.
964944088696049666 Charges Deal Don A Big Win, written by Michael Goodwin of the @nypost, succinctly states that the Russians had no impact on the election results. There was no Collusion with the Trump Campaign. She lost the old-fashioned way, by being a terrible candidate. Case closed.
964938678362628096 Melania and I met such incredible people last night in Broward County, Florida. Will never forget them, or the evening!
964724390637244417 Our entire Nation, w/one heavy heart, continues to pray for the victims & their families in Parkland, FL. To teachers, law enforcement, first responders & medical professionals who responded so bravely in the face of danger: We THANK YOU for your courage!
964594780088033282 Russia started their anti-US campaign in 2014, long before I announced that I would run for President. The results of the election were not impacted. The Trump campaign did nothing wrong - no collusion!
964512164865363968 Cannot believe how BADLY DACA recipients have been treated by the Democrats...totally abandoned! Republicans are still working hard.
964509154357411840 I will be leaving for Florida today to meet with some of the bravest people on earth - but people whose lives have been totally shattered. Am also working with Congress on many fronts.
964232645495459840 Presidential Proclamation Honoring the Victims of the Tragedy in Parkland, Florida:
964219299211735040 ...lottery, continues deadly catch-and-release, and bars enforcement even for FUTURE illegal immigrants. Voting for this amendment would be a vote AGAINST law enforcement, and a vote FOR open borders. If Dems are actually serious about DACA, they should support the Grassley bill!
964219102683377665 The Schumer-Rounds-Collins immigration bill would be a total catastrophe. @DHSgov says it would be the end of immigration enforcement in America. It creates a giant amnesty (including for dangerous criminals), doesn't build the wall, expands chain migration, keeps the visa...
964190995687591936 In times of tragedy, the bonds that sustain us are those of family, faith, community, and country. These bonds are stronger than the forces of hatred and evil - and these bonds grow even stronger in the hours of our greatest need.
964151653669711872 While the Republicans and Democrats in Congress are working hard to come up with a solution to DACA, they should be strongly considering a system of Merit Based Immigration so that we will have the people ready, willing and able to help all of those companies moving into the USA!
964110212885106689 So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior. Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again!
963879275324760070 Just spoke to Governor Rick Scott. We are working closely with law enforcement on the terrible Florida school shooting.
963878055969198080 My prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting. No child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school.
963853233000275969 Today, I was honored to be joined by Republicans and Democrats from both the House and Senate, as well as members of my Cabinet - to discuss the urgent need to rebuild and restore America's depleted infrastructure.
963839056533626880 As we come together to celebrate the extraordinary contributions of African-Americans to our nation, our thoughts turn to the heroes of the civil rights movement whose courage and sacrifice have inspired us all. Proclamation:
963365328716812288 Negotiations on DACA have begun. Republicans want to make a deal and Democrats say they want to make a deal. Wouldn't it be great if we could finally, after so many years, solve the DACA puzzle. This will be our last chance, there will never be another opportunity! March 5th.
963362959463469058 Our infrastructure plan has been put forward and has received great reviews by everyone except, of course, the Democrats. After many years we have taken care of our Military, now we have to fix our roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and more. Bipartisan, make deal Dems?
963152799486828544 The journey to #MAGA began @CPAC 2011 and the opportunity to reconnect with friends and supporters is something I look forward to every year. See you at #CPAC2018!
963033580107653120 Thank you to Sue Kruczek, who lost her wonderful and talented son Nick to the Opioid scourge, for your kind words while on @foxandfriends. We are fighting this terrible epidemic hard - Nick will not have died in vain!
963031666150313984 This will be a big week for Infrastructure. After so stupidly spending $7 trillion in the Middle East, it is now time to start investing in OUR Country!
962787355932360706 Just spoke to @JohnKasich to express condolences and prayers to all for the horrible shooting of two great police officers from @WestervillePD. This is a true tragedy!
962784821389996033 Rep. Lou Barletta, a Great Republican from Pennsylvania who was one of my very earliest supporters, will make a FANTASTIC Senator. He is strong & smart, loves Pennsylvania & loves our Country! Voted for Tax Cuts, unlike Bob Casey, who listened to Tax Hikers Pelosi and Schumer!
962767075457593344 4.2 million hard working Americans have already received a large Bonus and/or Pay Increase because of our recently Passed Tax Cut & Jobs Bill....and it will only get better! We are far ahead of schedule.
962753552824365056 So many positive things going on for the U.S.A. and the Fake News Media just doesn't want to go there. Same negative stories over and over again! No wonder the People no longer trust the media, whose approval ratings are correctly at their lowest levels in history! #MAGA
962469767109009408 My Administration has identified three major priorities for creating a safe, modern and lawful immigration system: fully securing the border, ending chain migration, and canceling the visa lottery. Congress must secure the immigration system and protect Americans.
962435602296786944 My thoughts and prayers are with the two police officers, their families, and everybody at the @WestervillePD.
962398269593784321 Republicans want to fix DACA far more than the Democrats do. The Dems had all three branches of government back in 2008-2011, and they decided not to do anything about DACA. They only want to use it as a campaign issue. Vote Republican!
962394439846191105 ....agencies, not just the FBI & DOJ, now the State Department to dig up dirt on him in the days leading up to the Election. Comey had conversations with Donald Trump, which I don't believe were accurate...he leaked information (corrupt). Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch on @FoxNews
962389786328797184 My view is that not only has Trump been vindicated in the last several weeks about the mishandling of the Dossier and the lies about the Clinton/DNC Dossier, it shows that he's been victimized. He's been victimized by the Obama Administration who were using all sorts of.......
962348831789797381 Peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused - life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?
962345433170415616 According to the @nytimes, a Russian sold phony secrets on Trump to the U.S. Asking price was $10 million, brought down to $1 million to be paid over time. I hope people are now seeing & understanding what is going on here. It is all now starting to come out - DRAIN THE SWAMP!
962330457886076928 The Democrats sent a very political and long response memo which they knew, because of sources and methods (and more), would have to be heavily redacted, whereupon they would blame the White House for lack of transparency. Told them to re-do and send back in proper form!
962326008127946752 Jobless claims have dropped to a 45 year low!
961962694650757121 Costs on non-military lines will never come down if we do not elect more Republicans in the 2018 Election, and beyond. This Bill is a BIG VICTORY for our Military, but much waste in order to get Dem votes. Fortunately, DACA not included in this Bill, negotiations to start now!
961959738853548033 Without more Republicans in Congress, we were forced to increase spending on things we do not like or want in order to finally, after many years of depletion, take care of our Military. Sadly, we needed some Dem votes for passage. Must elect more Republicans in 2018 Election!
961957671246159875 Just signed Bill. Our Military will now be stronger than ever before. We love and need our Military and gave them everything Ã¢ and more. First time this has happened in a long time. Also means JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!
961802557646569475 Wow! -Senator Mark Warner got caught having extensive contact with a lobbyist for a Russian oligarch. Warner did not want a paper trail on a private meeting (in London) he requested with Steele of fraudulent Dossier fame. All tied into Crooked Hillary.
961743032952459264 Time to end the visa lottery. Congress must secure the immigration system and protect Americans.
961693860916289536 As long as we open our eyes to God's grace - and open our hearts to God's love - then America will forever be the land of the free, the home of the brave, and a light unto all nations. #NationalPrayerBreakfast
961671974153080834 I will be meeting with Henry Kissinger at 1:45pm. Will be discussing North Korea, China and the Middle East.
961649129834283008 Our founders invoked our Creator four times in the Declaration of Independence. Our currency declares IN GOD WE TRUST. And we place our hands on our hearts as we recite the Pledge of Allegiance and proclaim that we are One Nation Under God. #NationalPrayerBreakfast
961557382387167238 Will be heading over shortly to make remarks at The National Prayer Breakfast in Washington. Great religious and political leaders, and many friends, including T.V. producer Mark Burnett of our wonderful 14 season Apprentice triumph, will be there. Looking forward to seeing all!
961368036782628864 The Budget Agreement today is so important for our great Military. It ends the dangerous sequester and gives Secretary Mattis what he needs to keep America Great. Republicans and Democrats must support our troops and support this Bill!
961362249880252416 Congratulations to the Republic of Korea on what will be a MAGNIFICENT Winter Olympics! What the South Korean people have built is truly an inspiration!
961298788219420672 Best wishes to the Republic of Korea on hosting the @Olympics! What a wonderful opportunity to show everyone that you are a truly GREAT NATION!
961270833569202176 NEW FBI TEXTS ARE BOMBSHELLS!
961253168968622086 In the old days, when good news was reported, the Stock Market would go up. Today, when good news is reported, the Stock Market goes down. Big mistake, and we have so much good (great) news about the economy!
961073467784421382 Congratulations @ElonMusk and @SpaceX on the successful #FalconHeavy launch. This achievement, along with @NASA's commercial and international partners, continues to show American ingenuity at its best!
961038807658352640 HAPPY BIRTHDAY to our 40th President of the United States of America, Ronald Reagan!
961008057756127232 Today, we heard the experiences of law enforcement professionals and community leaders working to combat the threat of MS-13, and the reforms we need from Congress to defeat it. Watch here:
960907362109452288 We need a 21st century MERIT-BASED immigration system. Chain migration and the visa lottery are outdated programs that hurt our economic and national security.
960906105982464000 Polling shows nearly 7 in 10 Americans support an immigration reform package that includes DACA, fully secures the border, ends chain migration & cancels the visa lottery. If D's oppose this deal, they aren't serious about DACA-they just want open borders.
960869939694505984 My prayers and best wishes are with the family of Edwin Jackson, a wonderful young man whose life was so senselessly taken. @Colts
960868920428253184 So disgraceful that a person illegally in our country killed @Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson. This is just one of many such preventable tragedies. We must get the Dems to get tough on the Border, and with illegal immigration, FAST!
960614513224667136 Thanks to the historic TAX CUTS that I signed into law, your paychecks are going way UP, your taxes are going way DOWN, and America is once again OPEN FOR BUSINESS!
960530665702912000 Representative Devin Nunes, a man of tremendous courage and grit, may someday be recognized as a Great American Hero for what he has exposed and what he has had to endure!
960522569492426753 Any deal on DACA that does not include STRONG border security and the desperately needed WALL is a total waste of time. March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Dems seem not to care about DACA. Make a deal!
960492998734868480 Little Adam Schiff, who is desperate to run for higher office, is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington, right up there with Comey, Warner, Brennan and Clapper! Adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information. Must be stopped!
960487657691385856 Thank you to @foxandfriends for exposing the truth. Perhaps that's why your ratings are soooo much better than your untruthful competition!
960486144818450432 The Democrats are pushing for Universal HealthCare while thousands of people are marching in the UK because their U system is going broke and not working. Dems want to greatly raise taxes for really bad and non-personal medical care. No thanks!
960361010904338432 Congratulations to the Philadelphia Eagles on a great Super Bowl victory!
960195808141414400 My thoughts and prayers are with all of the victims involved in this mornings train collision in South Carolina. Thank you to our incredible First Responders for the work they've done!
959952974826098688 ...a tool of anti-Trump political actors. This is unacceptable in a democracy and ought to alarm anyone who wants the FBI to be a nonpartisan enforcer of the law....The FBI wasn't straight with Congress, as it hid most of these facts from investigators. Wall Street Journal
959949725028974592 The four page memo released Friday reports the disturbing fact about how the FBI and FISA appear to have been used to influence the 2016 election and its aftermath....The FBI failed to inform the FISA court that the Clinton campaign had funded the dossier....the FBI became....
959946200488271872 Great jobs numbers and finally, after many years, rising wages- and nobody even talks about them. Only Russia, Russia, Russia, despite the fact that, after a year of looking, there is No Collusion!
959798743842349056 This memo totally vindicates Trump in probe. But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on. Their was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction (the word now used because, after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING, collusion is dead). This is an American disgrace!
959798726381457409 Rasmussen just announced that my approval rating jumped to 49%, a far better number than I had in winning the Election, and higher than certain sacred cows. Other Trump polls are way up also. So why does the media refuse to write this? Oh well, someday!
959553606134345728 Today, it was my honor to join the great men and women of @DHSgov, @CustomsBorder, @ICEgov and @USCIS at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection National Targeting Center in Sterling, Virginia. Fact sheet:
959488369293254658 Trump the orator outlines the greatness of America to Democrats' disgust
959488037766955009 With 3.5 million Americans receiving bonuses or other benefits from their employers as a result of TAX CUTS, 2018 is off to great start! Unemployment rate at 4.1%. Average earnings up 2.9% in the last year. 200,000 new American jobs.
959393270144086016 You had Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party try to hide the fact that they gave money to GPS Fusion to create a Dossier which was used by their allies in the Obama Administration to convince a Court misleadingly, by all accounts, to spy on the Trump Team. Tom Fitton, JW
959389424806191104 The top Leadership and Investigators of the FBI and the Justice Department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans - something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago. Rank & File are great people!
959268334935203840 The Democrats just aren't calling about DACA. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have to get moving fast, or they'll disappoint you again. We have a great chance to make a deal or, blame the Dems! March 5th is coming up fast.
959034299222843394 Thank you for all of the nice compliments and reviews on the State of the Union speech. 45.6 million people watched, the highest number in history. @FoxNews beat every other Network, for the first time ever, with 11.7 million people tuning in. Delivered from the heart!
959031505145212928 March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Democrats are doing nothing about DACA. They Resist, Blame, Complain and Obstruct - and do nothing. Start pushing Nancy Pelosi and the Dems to work out a DACA fix, NOW!
959029384052166657 Heading to beautiful West Virginia to be with great members of the Republican Party. Will be planning Infrastructure and discussing Immigration and DACA, not easy when we have no support from the Democrats. NOT ONE DEM VOTED FOR OUR TAX CUT BILL! Need more Republicans in Ã¢18.
958520216429957121 Join me live for the #SOTU
958070403901124609 Congratulations to America's new Secretary of @HHSGov, Alex Azar!
957603804383465472 Our economy is better than it has been in many decades. Businesses are coming back to America like never before. Chrysler, as an example, is leaving Mexico and coming back to the USA. Unemployment is nearing record lows. We are on the right track!
957603800579297280 Somebody please inform Jay-Z that because of my policies, Black Unemployment has just been reported to be at the LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED!
957465263129219073 Democrats are not interested in Border Safety & Security or in the funding and rebuilding of our Military. They are only interested in Obstruction!
957462746060206080 I have offered DACA a wonderful deal, including a doubling in the number of recipients & a twelve year pathway to citizenship, for two reasons: (1) Because the Republicans want to fix a long time terrible problem. (2) To show that Democrats do not want to solve DACA, only use it!
957387711693905925 Taliban targeted innocent Afghans, brave police in Kabul today. Our thoughts and prayers go to the victims, and first responders. We will not allow the Taliban to win!
957334999522533376 On Holocaust Remembrance Day we mourn and grieve the murder of 6 million innocent Jewish men, women and children, and the millions of others who perished in the evil Nazi Genocide. We pledge with all of our might and resolve: Never Again!
957220637705109505 Thank you to Brandon Judd of the National Border Patrol Council for his strong statement on @foxandfriends that we very badly NEED THE WALL. Must also end loophole of catch & release and clean up the legal and other procedures at the border NOW for Safety & Security reasons.
957032249509097472 Thank you for the wonderful welcome @WEF! #Davos2018
956938973326098432 DACA has been made increasingly difficult by the fact that Cryin' Chuck Schumer took such a beating over the shutdown that he is unable to act on immigration!
956937916374138880 Heading back from a very exciting two days in Davos, Switzerland. Speech on America's economic revival was well received. Many of the people I met will be investing in the U.S.A.! #MAGA
956873004776116225 Join me live at the 2018 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland! #WEF18
956849981528379392 Great bilateral meeting with President @Alain_Berset of the Swiss Confederation - as we continue to strengthen our great friendship. Such an honor to be in Switzerland! #WEF18
956840839627595776 It was an honor to meet with Republic of Rwanda President Paul Kagame this morning in Davos, Switzerland. Many great discussions! #WEF18
956831942351183873 Will be interviewed on @SquawkCNBC by @JoeSquawk coming up at 6:00amE from Davos, Switzerland. Enjoy! #WEF18
956657520562573312 Today, Americans everywhere remember the brave men and women of @NASA who lost their lives in our Nation's eternal quest to expand the boundaries of human potential.
956588348864454656 Very productive bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin @Netanyahu of Israel - in Davos, Switzerland! #WEF18
956578887160532992 Great bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom, affirming the special relationship and our commitment to work together on key national security challenges and economic opportunities. #WEF18
956322473955545089 Will soon be heading to Davos, Switzerland, to tell the world how great America is and is doing. Our economy is now booming and with all I am doing, will only get better...Our country is finally WINNING again!
956298399946563585 It was my great honor to welcome Mayor's from across America to the WH. My Administration will always support local government - and listen to the leaders who know their communities best. Together, we will usher in a bold new era of Peace and Prosperity!
956261892640604161 Earlier today, I spoke with @GovMattBevin of Kentucky regarding yesterday's shooting at Marshall County High School. My thoughts and prayers are with Bailey Holt, Preston Cope, their families, and all of the wounded victims who are in recovery. We are with you!
956134228726558720 Tremendous investment by companies from all over the world being made in America. There has never been anything like it. Now Disney, J.P. Morgan Chase and many others. Massive Regulation Reduction and Tax Cuts are making us a powerhouse again. Long way to go! Jobs, Jobs, Jobs!
956015565776277510 Cryin' Chuck Schumer fully understands, especially after his humiliating defeat, that if there is no Wall, there is no DACA. We must have safety and security, together with a strong Military, for our great people!
956012274942128128 Where are the 50,000 important text messages between FBI lovers Lisa Page and Peter Strzok? Blaming Samsung!
955806333667807232 Thank you to General John Kelly, who is doing a fantastic job, and all of the Staff and others in the White House, for a job well done. Long hours and Fake reporting makes your job more difficult, but it is always great to WIN, and few have won more than us!
955795912374267907 Nobody knows for sure that the Republicans & Democrats will be able to reach a deal on DACA by February 8, but everyone will be trying....with a big additional focus put on Military Strength and Border Security. The Dems have just learned that a Shutdown is not the answer!
955771016319590400 In one of the biggest stories in a long time, the FBI now says it is missing five months worth of lovers Strzok-Page texts, perhaps 50,000, and all in prime time. Wow!
955769850022055936 In one of the biggest stories in a long time, the FBI says it is now missing five months worth of lovers Strzok - Page texts, perhaps 50,000, all in prime time. Wow!
955764970590961665 Even Crazy Jim Acosta of Fake News CNN agrees: Trump World and WH sources dancing in end zone: Trump wins again...Schumer and Dems caved...gambled and lost. Thank you for your honesty Jim!
955658992793149440 Big win for Republicans as Democrats cave on Shutdown. Now I want a big win for everyone, including Republicans, Democrats and DACA, but especially for our Great Military and Border Security. Should be able to get there. See you at the negotiating table!
955458357200130049 End the Democrats Obstruction!
955428815777533952 Democrats have shut down our government in the interests of their far left base. They don't want to do it but are powerless!
955426609326100480 The Democrats are turning down services and security for citizens in favor of services and security for non-citizens. Not good!
955249077645643776 Thank you to Brad Blakeman on @FoxNews for grading year one of my presidency with an A-and likewise to Doug Schoen for the very good grade and statements. Working hard!
955056249925750784 Great to see how hard Republicans are fighting for our Military and Safety at the Border. The Dems just want illegal immigrants to pour into our nation unchecked. If stalemate continues, Republicans should go to 51% (Nuclear Option) and vote on real, long term budget, no C.R.'s!
954901073587834882 Eric Trump on @JudgeJeanine on @FoxNews now!
954878124214415360 The Trump Administration has terminated more UNNECESSARY Regulation, in just twelve months, than any other Administration has terminated during their full term in office, no matter what the length. The good news is, THERE IS MUCH MORE TO COME!
954843844402647040 Unprecedented success for our Country, in so many ways, since the Election. Record Stock Market, Strong on Military, Crime, Borders, & ISIS, Judicial Strength & Numbers, Lowest Unemployment for Women & ALL, Massive Tax Cuts, end of Individual Mandate - and so much more. Big 2018!
954788467069870081 Beautiful weather all over our great country, a perfect day for all Women to March. Get out there now to celebrate the historic milestones and unprecedented economic success and wealth creation that has taken place over the last 12 months. Lowest female unemployment in 18 years!
954722155463430145 Democrats are holding our Military hostage over their desire to have unchecked illegal immigration. Can't let that happen!
954680914998648833 For those asking, the Republicans only have 51 votes in the Senate, and they need 60. That is why we need to win more Republicans in 2018 Election! We can then be even tougher on Crime (and Border), and even better to our Military & Veterans!
954678287820902401 This is the One Year Anniversary of my Presidency and the Democrats wanted to give me a nice present. #DemocratShutdown
954674157144477696 Democrats are far more concerned with Illegal Immigrants than they are with our great Military or Safety at our dangerous Southern Border. They could have easily made a deal but decided to play Shutdown politics instead. #WeNeedMoreRepublicansIn18 in order to power through mess!
954541219970977793 Not looking good for our great Military or Safety & Security on the very dangerous Southern Border. Dems want a Shutdown in order to help diminish the great success of the Tax Cuts, and what they are doing for our booming economy.
954478044487520257 Excellent preliminary meeting in Oval with @SenSchumer - working on solutions for Security and our great Military together with @SenateMajLdr McConnell and @SpeakerRyan. Making progress - four week extension would be best!
954456754137501697 Just signed 702 Bill to reauthorize foreign intelligence collection. This is NOT the same FISA law that was so wrongly abused during the election. I will always do the right thing for our country and put the safety of the American people first!
954423170299199488 Today, I was honored and proud to address the 45th Annual @March_for_Life! You are living witnesses of this year's March for Life theme: #LoveSavesLives.
954390114968498176 Shutting down the government is a very serious thing. People die, accidents happen. I don't know how I would vote right now on a CR, OK? Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif)
954386490842378241 @WhiteHouse Briefing with Director Marc Short and Director Mick Mulvaney...
954323750949982208 Government Funding Bill past last night in the House of Representatives. Now Democrats are needed if it is to pass in the Senate - but they want illegal immigration and weak borders. Shutdown coming? We need more Republican victories in 2018!
954136290768846850 House of Representatives needs to pass Government Funding Bill tonight. So important for our country - our Military needs it!
954097213608570880 AMERICA will once again be a NATION that thinks big, dreams bigger, and always reaches for the stars. YOU are the ones who will shape America's destiny. YOU are the ones who will restore our prosperity. And YOU are the ones who are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! #MAGA
954092417250222082 Departing Pittsburgh now, where it was my great honor to stand with our incredible workers, and to show the world that AMERICA is back - and we are coming back bigger and better and stronger than ever before!
953987636057821184 A government shutdown will be devastating to our military...something the Dems care very little about!
953984671674662912 CHIP should be part of a long term solution, not a 30 Day, or short term, extension!
953979393180950528 We need the Wall for the safety and security of our country. We need the Wall to help stop the massive inflow of drugs from Mexico, now rated the number one most dangerous country in the world. If there is no Wall, there is no Deal!
953973568035086336 Will be going to Pennsylvania today in order to give my total support to RICK SACCONE, running for Congress in a Special Election (March 13). Rick is a great guy. We need more Republicans to continue our already successful agenda!
953951365532876800 ....The Wall will be paid for, directly or indirectly, or through longer term reimbursement, by Mexico, which has a ridiculous $71 billion dollar trade surplus with the U.S. The $20 billion dollar Wall is peanuts compared to what Mexico makes from the U.S. NAFTA is a bad joke!
953948941674078208 The Wall is the Wall, it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it. Parts will be, of necessity, see through and it was never intended to be built in areas where there is natural protection such as mountains, wastelands or tough rivers or water.....
953796944564031489 ISIS is in retreat, our economy is booming, investments and jobs are pouring back into the country, and so much more! Together there is nothing we can't overcome--even a very biased media. We ARE Making America Great Again!
953795518592843777 Despite some very corrupt and dishonest media coverage, there are many great reporters I respect and lots of GOOD NEWS for the American people to be proud of!
953794085751574534 And the FAKE NEWS winners are...
953773110553186312 Main Street is BACK! Strongest Holiday Sales bump since the Great Recession -- beating forecasts by BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
953772162665590787 During the campaign, I promised to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN by bringing businesses and jobs back to our country. I am very proud to see companies like Chrysler moving operations from Mexico to Michigan where there are so many great American workers!
953771038114045954 I promised that my policies would allow companies like Apple to bring massive amounts of money back to the United States. Great to see Apple follow through as a result of TAX CUTS. Huge win for American workers and the USA!
953768657221451776 Today, we witnessed an incredible moment in history Ã¢ the presentation of Congress' highest civilian honor to our friend, and true AMERICAN HERO, Bob Dole. #CongressionalGoldMedal
953614071336701952 Eric Trump on @foxandfriends now!
953406553083777029 ....we need to keep America safe, including moving away from a random chain migration and lottery system, to one that is merit-based.
953406423177859073 New report from DOJ & DHS shows that nearly 3 in 4 individuals convicted of terrorism-related charges are foreign-born. We have submitted to Congress a list of resources and reforms....
953360619834691585 Today, it was my honor to welcome President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan to the @WhiteHouse!
953352036309000194 President Donald J. Trump Proclaims January 16, 2018, as Religious Freedom Day
953273134655987716 Unemployment for Black Americans is the lowest ever recorded. Trump approval ratings with Black Americans has doubled. Thank you, and it will get even (much) better! @FoxNews
953271789790138368 90% of Trump 2017 news coverage was negative -and much of it contrived!@foxandfriends
953270558573154305 Do you notice the Fake News Mainstream Media never likes covering the great and record setting economic news, but rather talks about anything negative or that can be turned into the negative. The Russian Collusion Hoax is dead, except as it pertains to the Dems. Public gets it!
953267506004754432 The Democrats want to shut down the Government over Amnesty for all and Border Security. The biggest loser will be our rapidly rebuilding Military, at a time we need it more than ever. We need a merit based system of immigration, and we need it now! No more dangerous Lottery.
953264081871495168 We must have Security at our VERY DANGEROUS SOUTHERN BORDER, and we must have a great WALL to help protect us, and to help stop the massive inflow of drugs pouring into our country!
953000902331453442 Senator Dicky Durbin totally misrepresented what was said at the DACA meeting. Deals can't get made when there is no trust! Durbin blew DACA and is hurting our Military.
952888691944550401 ...to stop drugs, they want to take money away from our military which we cannot do. My standard is very simple, AMERICA FIRST & MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
952887520790040576 Statement by me last night in Florida: Honestly, I don't think the Democrats want to make a deal. They talk about DACA, but they don't want to help..We are ready, willing and able to make a deal but they don't want to. They don't want security at the border, they don't want.....
952540700683497472 ...big unnecessary regulation cuts made it all possible (among many other things). President Trump reversed the policies of President Obama, and reversed our economic decline. Thank you Stuart Varney. @foxandfriends
952538350333939713 President Trump is not getting the credit he deserves for the economy. Tax Cut bonuses to more than 2,000,000 workers. Most explosive Stock Market rally that we've seen in modern times. 18,000 to 26,000 from Election, and grounded in profitability and growth. All Trump, not 0...
952530515894169601 I, as President, want people coming into our Country who are going to help us become strong and great again, people coming in through a system based on MERIT. No more Lotteries! #AMERICA FIRST
952528011869478912 DACA is probably dead because the Democrats don't really want it, they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our Military.
952526145064505345 ...and they knew exactly what I said and meant. They just wanted a story. FAKE NEWS!
952525384242876416 The Wall Street Journal stated falsely that I said to them I have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un (of N. Korea). Obviously I didn't say that. I said I'd have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un, a big difference. Fortunately we now record conversations with reporters...
952301373479104512 So much Fake News is being reported. They don't even try to get it right, or correct it when they are wrong. They promote the Fake Book of a mentally deranged author, who knowingly writes false information. The Mainstream Media is crazed that WE won the election!
952183458922672130 I don't believe the Democrats really want to see a deal on DACA. They are all talk and no action. This is the time but, day by day, they are blowing the one great opportunity they have. Too bad!
952183452366929920 Yesterday was another big day for jobs and the Stock Market. Chrysler coming back to U.S. (Michigan) from Mexico and many more companies paying out Tax Cut money to employees. If Dems won in November, Market would have TANKED! It was headed for disaster.
952166857670320128 The Democrats are all talk and no action. They are doing nothing to fix DACA. Great opportunity missed. Too bad!
952166643202916352 Yesterday was a big day for the stock market. Jobs are coming back to America. Chrysler is coming back to the USA, from Mexico and many others will follow. Tax cut money to employees is pouring into our economy with many more companies announcing. American business is hot again!
951875499537641472 Today, it was my great honor to proclaim January 15, 2018, as Martin Luther King Jr., Federal Holiday. I encourage all Americans to observe this day with appropriate civic, community, and service activities in honor of Dr. King's life and legacy.
951813216291708928 Never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country. Never said take them out. Made up by Dems. I have a wonderful relationship with Haitians. Probably should record future meetings - unfortunately, no trust!
951798415301718017 Sadly, Democrats want to stop paying our troops and government workers in order to give a sweetheart deal, not a fair deal, for DACA. Take care of our Military, and our Country, FIRST!
951793123985973248 The language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough, but this was not the language used. What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made - a big setback for DACA!
951790999784783872 ....Because of the Democrats not being interested in life and safety, DACA has now taken a big step backwards. The Dems will threaten shutdown, but what they are really doing is shutting down our military, at a time we need it most. Get smart, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
951788342647107584 ....countries which are doing badly. I want a merit based system of immigration and people who will help take our country to the next level. I want safety and security for our people. I want to stop the massive inflow of drugs. I want to fund our military, not do a Dem defund....
951785587765280768 The so-called bipartisan DACA deal presented yesterday to myself and a group of Republican Senators and Congressmen was a big step backwards. Wall was not properly funded, Chain & Lottery were made worse and USA would be forced to take large numbers of people from high crime.....
951679619341737986 Reason I canceled my trip to London is that I am not a big fan of the Obama Administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in London for peanuts, only to build a new one in an off location for 1.2 billion dollars. Bad deal. Wanted me to cut ribbon-NO!
951675713089888256 The Democrats seem intent on having people and drugs pour into our country from the Southern Border, risking thousands of lives in the process. It is my duty to protect the lives and safety of all Americans. We must build a Great Wall, think Merit and end Lottery & Chain. USA!
951650274032209920 Democrat Dianne Feinstein should never have released secret committee testimony to the public without authorization. Very disrespectful to committee members and possibly illegal. She blamed her poor decision on the fact she had a cold - a first!
951648197440569344 Chrysler is moving a massive plant from Mexico to Michigan, reversing a years long opposite trend. Thank you Chrysler, a very wise decision. The voters in Michigan are very happy they voted for Trump/Pence. Plenty of more to follow!
951647402599026689 More great news as a result of historical Tax Cuts and Reform: Fiat Chrysler announces plan to invest more than $1 BILLION in Michigan plant, relocating their heavy-truck production from Mexico to Michigan, adding 2,500 new jobs and paying $2,000 bonus to U.S. employees!
951646736233189377 Small Business Poll has highest approval numbers in the polls history. All business is just at the beginning of something really special!
951645893513613312 Thank you Adam Levine, The Federalist, in interview on @foxandfriends Donald Trump is the greatest President our Country has ever seen.
951596346011680768 Yesterday, I signed the #INTERDICTAct (H.R. 2142) with bipartisan members of Congress to help end the flow of drugs into our country. Together, we are committed to doing everything we can to combat the deadly scourge of drug addiction and overdose in the United States!
951478281303416832 Great news, as a result of our TAX CUTS & JOBS ACT!
951457382651056128 With that being said, I have personally directed the fix to the unmasking process since taking office and today's vote is about foreign surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land. We need it! Get smart!
951441504203104256 45 year low in illegal immigration this year. @foxandfriends
951431836030459905 House votes on controversial FISA ACT today. This is the act that may have been used, with the help of the discredited and phony Dossier, to so badly surveil and abuse the Trump Campaign by the previous administration and others?
951419415794511872 In new Quinnipiac Poll, 66% of people feel the economy is Excellent or Good. That is the highest number ever recorded by this poll.
951416674808467461 Disproven and paid for by Democrats Dossier used to spy on Trump Campaign. Did FBI use Intel tool to influence the Election? @foxandfriends Did Dems or Clinton also pay Russians? Where are hidden and smashed DNC servers? Where are Crooked Hillary Emails? What a mess!
951309956720087041 Good news: Toyota and Mazda announce giant new Huntsville, Alabama, plant which will produce over 300,000 cars and SUV's a year and employ 4000 people. Companies are coming back to the U.S. in a very big way. Congratulations Alabama!
951236634095308800 Cutting taxes and simplifying regulations makes America the place to invest! Great news as Toyota and Mazda announce they are bringing 4,000 JOBS and investing $1.6 BILLION in Alabama, helping to further grow our economy!
951229113897013248 The United States needs the security of the Wall on the Southern Border, which must be part of any DACA approval. The safety and security of our country is #1!
951204878562549767 Today, it was my great honor to welcome Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway to the @WhiteHouse - a great friend and ally of the United States! Joint press conference:
951184020150382592 I want to thank my @Cabinet for working tirelessly on behalf of our country. 2017 was a year of monumental achievement and we look forward to the year ahead. Together, we are delivering results and MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
951109942685126656 The single greatest Witch Hunt in American history continues. There was no collusion, everybody including the Dems knows there was no collusion, & yet on and on it goes. Russia & the world is laughing at the stupidity they are witnessing. Republicans should finally take control!
951106475254059008 The fact that Sneaky Dianne Feinstein, who has on numerous occasions stated that collusion between Trump/Russia has not been found, would release testimony in such an underhanded and possibly illegal way, totally without authorization, is a disgrace. Must have tough Primary!
951094078661414912 It just shows everyone how broken and unfair our Court System is when the opposing side in a case (such as DACA) always runs to the 9th Circuit and almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts.
950946293077209088 @ICEgov HSI agents and ERO officers, on behalf of an entire Nation, THANK YOU for what you are doing 24/7/365 to keep fellow American's SAFE. Everyone is so grateful!
950937350003183618 Thank you @GOPLeader Kevin McCarthy! Couldn't agree w/you more. TOGETHER, we are #MAGAÃ°Å¸ÂºÃ°Å¸Â¸
950884128379035650 As I made very clear today, our country needs the security of the Wall on the Southern Border, which must be part of any DACA approval.
950866561153331202 Today, it was my great honor to sign a new Executive Order to ensure Veterans have the resources they need as they transition back to civilian life. We must ensure that our HEROES are given the care and support they so richly deserve!
947614110082043904 HAPPY NEW YEAR! We are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, and much faster than anyone thought possible!
947592785519173637 As our Country rapidly grows stronger and smarter, I want to wish all of my friends, supporters, enemies, haters, and even the very dishonest Fake News Media, a Happy and Healthy New Year. 2018 will be a great year for America!
947588263103139841 Iran, the Number One State of Sponsored Terror with numerous violations of Human Rights occurring on an hourly basis, has now closed down the Internet so that peaceful demonstrators cannot communicate. Not good!
947544600918372353 What a year it's been, and we're just getting started. Together, we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Happy New Year!!
947536951464333318 My deepest condolences to the victims of the terrible shooting in Douglas County @DCSheriff, and their families. We love our police and law enforcement - God Bless them all! #LESM
947461470924820480 Why would smart voters want to put Democrats in Congress in 2018 Election when their policies will totally kill the great wealth created during the months since the Election. People are much better off now not to mention ISIS, VA, Judges, Strong Border, 2nd A, Tax Cuts & more?
947458942719979520 If the Dems (Crooked Hillary) got elected, your stocks would be down 50% from values on Election Day. Now they have a great future - and just beginning!
947453152806297600 Big protests in Iran. The people are finally getting wise as to how their money and wealth is being stolen and squandered on terrorism. Looks like they will not take it any longer. The USA is watching very closely for human rights violations!
947328044821336070 Trump Rally: Stocks put 2017 in the record books
947236393184628741 Jobs are kicking in and companies are coming back to the U.S. Unnecessary regulations and high taxes are being dramatically Cut, and it will only get better. MUCH MORE TO COME!
947235015343202304 I use Social Media not because I like to, but because it is the only way to fight a VERY dishonest and unfair press, now often referred to as Fake News Media. Phony and non-existent sources are being used more often than ever. Many stories & reports a pure fiction!
947213895286054914 On Taxes: This is the biggest corporate rate cut ever, going back to the corporate income tax rate of roughly 80 years ago.This is a huge pro-growth stimulus for the economy. Every year the Obama WH overstated how the economy would grow. Now real economics and jobs. @WSJ Report
947181212468203520 Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the Iranian people will face a choice. The world is watching!
947180713236934657 The entire world understands that the good people of Iran want change, and, other than the vast military power of the United States, that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most....
946949708915924994 Many reports of peaceful protests by Iranian citizens fed up with regime's corruption & its squandering of the nation's wealth to fund terrorism abroad. Iranian govt should respect their people's rights, including right to express themselves. The world is watching! #IranProtests
946731576687235072 The Democrats have been told, and fully understand, that there can be no DACA without the desperately needed WALL at the Southern Border and an END to the horrible Chain Migration & ridiculous Lottery System of Immigration etc. We must protect our Country at all cost!
946728546633953285 Why is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE!
946724075157651457 While the Fake News loves to talk about my so-called low approval rating, @foxandfriends just showed that my rating on Dec. 28, 2017, was approximately the same as President Obama on Dec. 28, 2009, which was 47%...and this despite massive negative Trump coverage & Russia hoax!
946531657229701120 In the East, it could be the COLDEST New Year's Eve on record. Perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country, but not other countries, was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against. Bundle up!
946519720450252800 Together, we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
946460939578167296 I've been saying it for a long, long time. #NoKo
946416486054285314 Caught RED HANDED - very disappointed that China is allowing oil to go into North Korea. There will never be a friendly solution to the North Korea problem if this continues to happen!
946415026402988033 Retail sales are at record numbers. We've got the economy going better than anyone ever dreamt - and you haven't seen anything yet!
946401576381505536 Vanity Fair, which looks like it is on its last legs, is bending over backwards in apologizing for the minor hit they took at Crooked H. Anna Wintour, who was all set to be Amb to Court of St James's & a big fundraiser for CH, is beside herself in grief & begging for forgiveness!
946210723528572930 Arrests of MS-13 Members, Associates Up 83% Under Trump
946201376652169220 On 1/20 - the day Trump was inaugurated - an estimated 35,000 ISIS fighters held approx 17,500 square miles of territory in both Iraq and Syria. As of 12/21, the U.S. military est the remaining 1,000 or so fighters occupy roughly 1,900 square miles.. @jamiejmcintyre @dcexaminer
946156544927977477 Just left West Palm Beach Fire & Rescue #2. Met with great men and women as representatives of those who do so much for all of us. Firefighters, paramedics, first responders - what amazing people they are!
946151080546750465 On 1/20 - the day Trump was inaugurated - an estimated 35,000 ISIS fighters held approx 17,500 square miles of territory in both Iraq and Syria. As of 12/21, the U.S. military estimates the remaining 1,000 or so fighters occupy roughly 1,900 square miles... via @jamiejmcintyre
945780569388015616 All signs are that business is looking really good for next year, only to be helped further by our Tax Cut Bill. Will be a great year for Companies and JOBS! Stock Market is poised for another year of SUCCESS!
945646491955290113 WOW, @foxandfrlends Dossier is bogus. Clinton Campaign, DNC funded Dossier. FBI CANNOT (after all of this time) VERIFY CLAIMS IN DOSSIER OF RUSSIA/TRUMP COLLUSION. FBI TAINTED. And they used this Crooked Hillary pile of garbage as the basis for going after the Trump Campaign!
945624910898122752 Based on the fact that the very unfair and unpopular Individual Mandate has been terminated as part of our Tax Cut Bill, which essentially Repeals (over time) ObamaCare, the Democrats & Republicans will eventually come together and develop a great new HealthCare plan!
945437479863291904 I hope everyone is having a great Christmas, then tomorrow it's back to work in order to Make America Great Again (which is happening faster than anyone anticipated)!
945126026824298497 People are proud to be saying Merry Christmas again. I am proud to have led the charge against the assault of our cherished and beautiful phrase. MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!!!
945030174290186241 The Tax Cut/Reform Bill, including Massive Alaska Drilling and the Repeal of the highly unpopular Individual Mandate, brought it all together as to what an incredible year we had. Don't let the Fake News convince you otherwise...and our insider Polls are strong!
944927689638662145 The Fake News refuses to talk about how Big and how Strong our BASE is. They show Fake Polls just like they report Fake News. Despite only negative reporting, we are doing well - nobody is going to beat us. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
944906847970119680 @FoxNews-FBI's Andrew McCabe, in addition to his wife getting all of this money from M (Clinton Puppet), he was using, allegedly, his FBI Official Email Account to promote her campaign. You obviously cannot do this. These were the people who were investigating Hillary Clinton.
944703626454487042 Remember, the Republicans are 5-0 in Congressional races this year. In Senate, I said Roy M would lose in Alabama and supported Big Luther Strange - and Roy lost. Virginia candidate was not a Trumper, and he lost. Good Republican candidates will win BIG!
944700332881440769 The Stock Market is setting record after record and unemployment is at a 17 year low. So many things accomplished by the Trump Administration, perhaps more than any other President in first year. Sadly, will never be reported correctly by the Fake News Media!
944667102312566784 Wow, FBI lawyer James Baker reassigned, according to @FoxNews.
944666448185692166 FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is racing the clock to retire with full benefits. 90 days to go?!!!
944665687292817415 How can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the man in charge, along with leakin' James Comey, of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700,000 for wife's campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation?
944329684032081921 Remember, the most hated part of ObamaCare is the Individual Mandate, which is being terminated under our just signed Tax Cut Bill.
944308491887316992 Today, it was my great honor to sign the largest TAX CUTS and reform in the history of our country. Full remarks:
944308373373308929 The United Nations Security Council just voted 15-0 in favor of additional Sanctions on North Korea. The World wants Peace, not Death!
944276471614509057 Congressman Ron DeSantis is a brilliant young leader, Yale and then Harvard Law, who would make a GREAT Governor of Florida. He loves our Country and is a true FIGHTER!
944247868126318593 95% of Americans will pay less or, at worst, the same amount of taxes (mostly far less). The Dems only want to raise your taxes!
944222979147337728 Will be signing the biggest ever Tax Cut and Reform Bill in 30 minutes in Oval Office. Will also be signing a much needed 4 billion dollar missile defense bill.
944222157218942978 With all my Administration has done on Legislative Approvals (broke Harry Truman's Record), Regulation Cutting, Judicial Appointments, Building Military, VA, TAX CUTS & REFORM, Record Economy/Stock Market and so much more, I am sure great credit will be given by mainstream news?
944210183089254400 The President has accomplished some absolutely historic things during this past year. Thank you Charlie Kirk of Turning Points USA. Sadly, the Fake Mainstream Media will NEVER talk about our accomplishments in their end of year reviews. We are compiling a long & beautiful list.
944192071535153152 At some point, and for the good of the country, I predict we will start working with the Democrats in a Bipartisan fashion. Infrastructure would be a perfect place to start. After having foolishly spent $7 trillion in the Middle East, it is time to start rebuilding our country!
944187730564714497 Our big and very popular Tax Cut and Reform Bill has taken on an unexpected new source of love - that is big companies and corporations showering their workers with bonuses. This is a phenomenon that nobody even thought of, and now it is the rage. Merry Christmas!
943908041803657216 THANK YOU to everyone who joined me at the @WhiteHouse yesterday. Together, we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
943856675294982145 House Democrats want a SHUTDOWN for the holidays in order to distract from the very popular, just passed, Tax Cuts. House Republicans, don't let this happen. Pass the C.R. TODAY and keep our Government OPEN!
943842608631238656 Home Sales hit BEST numbers in 10 years! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
943824695144697857 Was @foxandfriends just named the most influential show in news? You deserve it - three great people! The many Fake News Hate Shows should study your formula for success!
943819430735372289 The Massive Tax Cuts, which the Fake News Media is desperate to write badly about so as to please their Democrat bosses, will soon be kicking in and will speak for themselves. Companies are already making big payments to workers. Dems want to raise taxes, hate these big Cuts!
943598090069536768 WE ARE MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
943543958730309633 We are delivering HISTORIC TAX RELIEF for the American people!
943534069287194626 Together, we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
943521141062238208 I would like to congratulate @SenateMajLdr on having done a fantastic job both strategically & politically on the passing in the Senate of the MASSIVE TAX CUT & Reform Bill. I could have not asked for a better or more talented partner. Our team will go onto many more VICTORIES!
943489378462130176 The Tax Cuts are so large and so meaningful, and yet the Fake News is working overtime to follow the lead of their friends, the defeated Dems, and only demean. This is truly a case where the results will speak for themselves, starting very soon. Jobs, Jobs, Jobs!
943362605258813441 The United States Senate just passed the biggest in history Tax Cut and Reform Bill. Terrible Individual Mandate (ObamaCare)Repealed. Goes to the House tomorrow morning for final vote. If approved, there will be a News Conference at The White House at approximately 1:00 P.M.
943213901625294849 Congratulations to Paul Ryan, Kevin McCarthy, Kevin Brady, Steve Scalise, Cathy McMorris Rodgers and all great House Republicans who voted in favor of cutting your taxes!
943135588496093190 A story in the @washingtonpost that I was close to rescinding the nomination of Justice Gorsuch prior to confirmation is FAKE NEWS. I never even wavered and am very proud of him and the job he is doing as a Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. The unnamed sources don't exist!
943079382163353600 Stocks and the economy have a long way to go after the Tax Cut Bill is totally understood and appreciated in scope and size. Immediate expensing will have a big impact. Biggest Tax Cuts and Reform EVER passed. Enjoy, and create many beautiful JOBS!
943074475209355264 DOW RISES 5000 POINTS ON THE YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
942921051721338880 Together, our task is to strengthen our families, to build up our communities, to serve our citizens, and to celebrate AMERICAN GREATNESS as a shining example to the world....
942904686125965312 With the strategy that I announced today, we are declaring that AMERICA is in the game and AMERICA is DETERMINED to WIN! OUR FOUR PILLARS OF NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY:
942883507868782592 70 Record Closes for the Dow so far this year! We have NEVER had 70 Dow Records in a one year period. Wow!
942882250089271297 Thank you Maria B!
942857031693799425 As the world watches, we are days away from passing HISTORIC TAX CUTS for American families and businesses. It will be the BIGGEST TAX CUT and TAX REFORM in the HISTORY of our country!
942854056162332677 When the American People speak, ALL OF US should listen. Just over one year ago, you spoke loud and clear. On November 8, 2016, you voted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
942851788461563906 Over the past 11 months, I have travelled tens of thousands of miles, to visit 13 countries. I have met with more than 100 world leaders and everywhere I traveled, it was my highest privilege and greatest honor to represent the AMERICAN PEOPLE!
942840800853024770 Our deepest sympathies and most heartfelt prayers are with the victims of the train derailment in Washington State. We are closely monitoring the situation and coordinating with local authorities...
942829676699021312 My thoughts and prayers are with everyone involved in the train accident in DuPont, Washington. Thank you to all of our wonderful First Responders who are on the scene. We are currently monitoring here at the White House.
942827072824672262 The train accident that just occurred in DuPont, WA shows more than ever why our soon to be submitted infrastructure plan must be approved quickly. Seven trillion dollars spent in the Middle East while our roads, bridges, tunnels, railways (and more) crumble! Not for long!
942721681130483712 Ivanka Trump will be interviewed on @foxandfriends.
942717030091943936 Remember, Republicans are 5-0 in Congressional Races this year. The media refuses to mention this. I said Gillespie and Moore would lose (for very different reasons), and they did. I also predicted I would win. Republicans will do well in 2018, very well! @foxandfriends
942551516564639744 More than a century after conquering flight, the #WrightBrothers continue to motivate & inspire Americans, who never tire of exploration & innovation. This GREAT AMERICAN SPIRIT can be found in the design of every new supersonic jet and next generation:
942503059103604736 Wonderful weekend at Camp David. A very special place. A lot of very important work done. Heading back to the @WhiteHouse now.
942439739264831488 As a candidate, I promised we would pass a massive TAX CUT for the everyday working American families who are the backbone and the heartbeat of our country. Now, we are just days away...
942123433873281024 TAX CUTS will increase investment in the American economy and in U.S. workers, leading to higher growth, higher wages, and more JOBS!
942044657613230080 Congratulations to two great and hardworking guys, Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie, on the success of their just out book, Let Trump Be Trump. Finally people with real knowledge are writing about our wonderful and exciting campaign!
941868639199916037 Great job Kevin, we are all proud of you!
941820213518938112 DOW, S&P 500 and NASDAQ close at record highs! #MAGA
941789515248750592 Today, it was my tremendous honor to visit Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) at the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Virginia. I am honored to serve as your Commander-in-Chief. On behalf of an entire Nation, THANK YOU for your sacrifice and service. We love you!
941756992070307845 You are always there for us Ã¢ THE MEN AND WOMEN IN BLUE. Thank you to our police, thank you to our sheriffs, and thank you to our law enforcement families. God Bless you all, and GOD BLESS AMERICA! #LESM
941723524921724928 To each member of the graduating class from the National Academy at Quantico, CONGRATULATIONS!
941667918214987776 It was my honor. THANK YOU!
941417725833998340 Manufacturing Optimism Rose to Another All-Time High in the Latest @ShopFloorNAM Outlook Survey
941406242785955841 In 1960, there were approximately 20,000 pages in the Code of Federal Regulations. Today there are over 185,000 pages, as seen in the Roosevelt Room. Today, we CUT THE RED TAPE! It is time to SET FREE OUR DREAMS and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
941404173433794561 When Americans are free to thrive, innovate, & prosper, there is no challenge too great, no task too large, & no goal beyond our reach. We are a nation of explorers, pioneers, innovators & inventors. We are nation of people who work hard, dream big, & who never, ever give up...
941400670766321666 Today, we gathered in the Roosevelt Room for one single reason: to CUT THE RED TAPE! For many decades, an ever-growing maze of regs, rules, and restrictions has cost our country trillions of dollars, millions of jobs, countless American factories, & devastated entire industries.
941353395121741825 As a candidate, I promised we would pass a massive tax cut for the everyday, working Americans. If you make your voices heard, this moment will be forever remembered as a great new beginning Ã¢ the dawn of a brilliant American future shining with PATRIOTISM, PROSPERITY AND PRIDE!
941291666564141057 Republican Tax Cuts are looking very good. All are working hard. In the meantime, the Stock Market hit another record high!
941094961482780672 Thank you Omarosa for your service! I wish you continued success.
940955920967880704 If last night's election proved anything, it proved that we need to put up GREAT Republican candidates to increase the razor thin margins in both the House and Senate.
940930017365778432 Wow, more than 90% of Fake News Media coverage of me is negative, with numerous forced retractions of untrue stories. Hence my use of Social Media, the only way to get the truth out. Much of Mainstream Meadia has become a joke! @foxandfriends
940904649728708609 The reason I originally endorsed Luther Strange (and his numbers went up mightily), is that I said Roy Moore will not be able to win the General Election. I was right! Roy worked hard but the deck was stacked against him!
940795587733151744 Congratulations to Doug Jones on a hard fought victory. The write-in votes played a very big factor, but a win is a win. The people of Alabama are great, and the Republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time. It never ends!
940706127309926400 Wishing all of those celebrating #Hanukkah around the world a happy and healthy eight nights in the company of those they love.
940588025964265472 Consumer Confidence is at an All-Time High, along with a Record High Stock Market. Unemployment is at a 17 year low. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Working to pass MASSIVE TAX CUTS (looking good).
940584383605563392 The people of Alabama will do the right thing. Doug Jones is Pro-Abortion, weak on Crime, Military and Illegal Immigration, Bad for Gun Owners and Veterans and against the WALL. Jones is a Pelosi/Schumer Puppet. Roy Moore will always vote with us. VOTE ROY MOORE!
940567812053053441 Lightweight Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a total flunky for Chuck Schumer and someone who would come to my office begging for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them), is now in the ring fighting against Trump. Very disloyal to Bill & Crooked-USED!
940554567414091776 Despite thousands of hours wasted and many millions of dollars spent, the Democrats have been unable to show any collusion with Russia - so now they are moving on to the false accusations and fabricated stories of women who I don't know and/or have never met. FAKE NEWS!
940223974985871360 Another false story, this time in the Failing @nytimes, that I watch 4-8 hours of television a day - Wrong! Also, I seldom, if ever, watch CNN or MSNBC, both of which I consider Fake News. I never watch Don Lemon, who I once called the dumbest man on television! Bad Reporting.
939967625362276354 Very little discussion of all the purposely false and defamatory stories put out this week by the Fake News Media. They are out of control - correct reporting means nothing to them. Major lies written, then forced to be withdrawn after they are exposed...a stain on America!
939851058788134913 Getting closer and closer on the Tax Cut Bill. Shaping up even better than projected. House and Senate working very hard and smart. End result will be not only important, but SPECIAL!
939849867438034944 Things are going really well for our economy, a subject the Fake News spends as little time as possible discussing! Stock Market hit another RECORD HIGH, unemployment is now at a 17 year low and companies are coming back into the USA. Really good news, and much more to come!
939680422493073408 No American should be separated from their loved ones because of preventable crime committed by those illegally in our country. Our cities should be Sanctuaries for Americans Ã¢ not for criminal aliens!
939642796289470464 Great Army - Navy Game. Army wins 14 to 13 and brings home the COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF'S TROPHY! Congratulations!
939640619105910784 Great Army - Navy Game. Army wins 14 to 13 and brings home the COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF'S TROPHY (last time was 1996). Wow! Congratulations!
939634404267380736 @daveweigel of the Washington Post just admitted that his picture was a FAKE (fraud?) showing an almost empty arena last night for my speech in Pensacola when, in fact, he knew the arena was packed (as shown also on T.V.). FAKE NEWS, he should be fired.
939616077356642304 @DaveWeigel @WashingtonPost put out a phony photo of an empty arena hours before I arrived @ the venue, w/ thousands of people outside, on their way in. Real photos now shown as I spoke. Packed house, many people unable to get in. Demand apology & retraction from FAKE NEWS WaPo!
939564681743814661 Have a great game today, @USArmy and @USNavy - I will be watching. We love our U.S. Military. On behalf of an entire Nation, THANK YOU for your sacrifice and service!
939560154269405184 It was my great honor to celebrate the opening of two extraordinary museums-the Mississippi State History Museum & the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum. We pay solemn tribute to our heroes of the past & dedicate ourselves to building a future of freedom, equality, justice & peace.
939521466634326016 Heading to the great state of Mississippi at the invitation of their popular and respected Governor, @PhilBryantMS. Look forward to seeing the new Civil Rights Museum!
939485131693322240 CNN'S slogan is CNN, THE MOST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS. Everyone knows this is not true, that this could, in fact, be a fraud on the American Public. There are many outlets that are far more trusted than Fake News CNN. Their slogan should be CNN, THE LEAST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS!
939480342779580416 Fake News CNN made a vicious and purposeful mistake yesterday. They were caught red handed, just like lonely Brian Ross at ABC News (who should be immediately fired for his mistake). Watch to see if @CNN fires those responsible, or was it just gross incompetence?
939477807813595136 A big contingent of very enthusiastic Roy Moore fans at the rally last night. We can't have a Pelosi/Schumer Liberal Democrat, Jones, in that important Alabama Senate seat. Need your vote to Make America Great Again! Jones will always vote against what we must do for our Country.
939475127552618496 GREAT EVENING last night in Pensacola, Florida. Arena was packed to the rafters, the crowd was loud, loving and really smart. They definitely get what's going on. Thank you Pensacola!
939375570919612416 We believe that every American should stand for the National Anthem, and we proudly pledge allegiance to one NATION UNDER GOD!
939355447273906182 This is your land, this is your home, and it's your voice that matters the most. So speak up, be heard, and fight, fight, fight for the change you've been waiting for your entire life! MERRY CHRISTMAS and THANK YOU Pensacola, Florida!
939299624875118592 Just arrived at the Pensacola Bay Center. Join me LIVE on @FoxNews in 10 minutes! #MAGA
939274666404909056 On my way to Pensacola, Florida. See everyone soon! #MAGA
939208571253862400 The unemployment rate remains at a 17-year low of 4.1%. The unemployment rate in manufacturing dropped to 2.6%, the lowest ever recorded. The unemployment rate among Hispanics dropped to 4.7%, the lowest ever recorded...
939189419386470401 MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
939152197090148352 Fines and penalties against Wells Fargo Bank for their bad acts against their customers and others will not be dropped, as has incorrectly been reported, but will be pursued and, if anything, substantially increased. I will cut Regs but make penalties severe when caught cheating!
939149296389251072 LAST thing the Make America Great Again Agenda needs is a Liberal Democrat in Senate where we have so little margin for victory already. The Pelosi/Schumer Puppet Jones would vote against us 100% of the time. He's bad on Crime, Life, Border, Vets, Guns & Military. VOTE ROY MOORE!
939120304542101505 Big crowd expected today in Pensacola, Florida, for a Make America Great Again speech. We have done so much in so short a period of time...and yet are planning to do so much more! See you there!
939006911629869056 I fulfilled my campaign promise - others didn't!
939005659982348291 Tonight, @FLOTUS Melania and I were thrilled to welcome so many wonderful friends to the @WhiteHouse Ã¢ and wish them all a very #HappyHanukkah
938878398608433152 Across the battlefields, oceans, and harrowing skies of Europe and the Pacific throughout the war, one great battle cry could be heard by America's friends and foes alike:
938873956345499654 Today, as we Remember Pearl Harbor, it was an incredible honor to be joined with surviving Veterans of the attack on 12/7/1941. They are HEROES, and they are living witnesses to American History. All American hearts are filled with gratitude for their service and their sacrifice.
938861758038577152 Today, the U.S. flag flies at half-staff at the @WhiteHouse, in honor of National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day.
938804374079459329 Today, our entire nation pauses to REMEMBER PEARL HARBORÃ¢and the brave warriors who on that day stood tall and fought for America. God Bless our HEROES who wear the uniform, and God Bless the United States of America. #PearlHarborRemembranceDayÃ°Å¸ÂºÃ°Å¸Â¸
938786402992578560 National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day - A day that will live in infamy! December 7, 1941
938756989542457344 Go get the new book on Andrew Jackson by Brian Kilmeade...Really good. @foxandfriends
938517073508163584 I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. I am also directing the State Department to begin preparation to move the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem...
938469354089385985 Join me live from the @WhiteHouse via #Periscope
938440878577856512 Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone in the path of California's wildfires. I encourage everyone to heed the advice and orders of local and state officials. THANK YOU to all First Responders for your incredible work!
938422792080457731 MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
938184577255919623 Join me this Friday in Pensacola, Florida at the Pensacola Bay Center! Tickets:
938102355878440960 Yesterday, I was thrilled to be with so many WONDERFUL friends, in Utah's MAGNIFICENT Capitol. It was my honor to sign two Presidential Proclamations that will modify the national monuments designations of both Bears Ears and Grand Staircase Escalante...
937661677700550656 A must watch: Legal Scholar Alan Dershowitz was just on @foxandfriends talking of what is going on with respect to the greatest Witch Hunt in U.S. political history. Enjoy!
937653535486959616 With the great vote on Cutting Taxes, this could be a big day for the Stock Market - and YOU!
937652739001212928 Putting Pelosi/Schumer Liberal Puppet Jones into office in Alabama would hurt our great Republican Agenda of low on taxes, tough on crime, strong on military and borders...& so much more. Look at your 401-k's since Election. Highest Stock Market EVER! Jobs are roaring back!
937641904338063361 Democrats refusal to give even one vote for massive Tax Cuts is why we need Republican Roy Moore to win in Alabama. We need his vote on stopping crime, illegal immigration, Border Wall, Military, Pro Life, V.A., Judges 2nd Amendment and more. No to Jones, a Pelosi/Schumer Puppet!
937314665176207360 Report: ANTI-TRUMP FBI AGENT LED CLINTON EMAIL PROBE Now it all starts to make sense!
937309279257792512 People who lost money when the Stock Market went down 350 points based on the False and Dishonest reporting of Brian Ross of @ABC News (he has been suspended), should consider hiring a lawyer and suing ABC for the damages this bad reporting has caused - many millions of dollars!
937305615218696193 After years of Comey, with the phony and dishonest Clinton investigation (and more), running the FBI, its reputation is in Tatters - worst in History! But fear not, we will bring it back to greatness.
937301085156503552 Tainted (no, very dishonest?) FBI agent's role in Clinton probe under review. Led Clinton Email probe. @foxandfriends Clinton money going to wife of another FBI agent in charge.
937297341266190336 Such a total miscarriage of Justice in San Francisco!
937279001684598784 I never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn. Just more Fake News covering another Comey lie!
937145025359761408 Congratulations to @ABC News for suspending Brian Ross for his horrendously inaccurate and dishonest report on the Russia, Russia, Russia Witch Hunt. More Networks and papers should do the same with their Fake News!
937142713211813889 Many people in our Country are asking what the Justice Department is going to do about the fact that totally Crooked Hillary, AFTER receiving a subpoena from the United States Congress, deleted and acid washed 33,000 Emails? No justice!
937141061343956992 So General Flynn lies to the FBI and his life is destroyed, while Crooked Hillary Clinton, on that now famous FBI holiday interrogation with no swearing in and no recording, lies many times...and nothing happens to her? Rigged system, or just a double standard?
937136868608626689 Great job First Lady Melania!
937065834635292673 62 years ago this week, a brave seamstress in Montgomery, Alabama uttered one word that changed history...
937007006526959618 I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!
936941673124425728 Biggest Tax Bill and Tax Cuts in history just passed in the Senate. Now these great Republicans will be going for final passage. Thank you to House and Senate Republicans for your hard work and commitment!
936864840240398337 We are one step closer to delivering MASSIVE tax cuts for working families across America. Special thanks to @SenateMajLdr Mitch McConnell and Chairman @SenOrrinHatch for shepherding our bill through the Senate. Look forward to signing a final bill before Christmas!
936713881711529986 Economists on the TAX CUTS and JOBS ACT: The enactment of a comprehensive overhaul - complete with a lower corporate tax rate - will IGNITE our ECONOMY with levels of GROWTH not SEEN IN GENERATIONS...
936688444046266368 The media has been speculating that I fired Rex Tillerson or that he would be leaving soon - FAKE NEWS! He's not leaving and while we disagree on certain subjects, (I call the final shots) we work well together and America is highly respected again!
936555753946705920 Republicans Senators are working hard to pass the biggest Tax Cuts in the history of our Country. The Bill is getting better and better. This is a once in a generation chance. Obstructionist Dems trying to block because they think it is too good and will not be given the credit!
936553863255031809 The jury was not told the killer of Kate was a 7 time felon. The Schumer/Pelosi Democrats are so weak on Crime that they will pay a big price in the 2018 and 2020 Elections.
936551346299338752 The Kate Steinle killer came back and back over the weakly protected Obama border, always committing crimes and being violent, and yet this info was not used in court. His exoneration is a complete travesty of justice. BUILD THE WALL!
936437372706836480 A disgraceful verdict in the Kate Steinle case! No wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration.
936395008139198464 The Christmas Story begins 2,000 years ago with a mother, a father, their baby son and the most extraordinary gift of allÃ¢the gift of God's love for all of humanity. Whatever our beliefs, we know that the birth of Jesus Christ and the story of his life...
936393574433939456 Today is a day that I've been looking very much forward to ALL YEAR LONG. It is one that you have heard me speak about many times before. Now, as President of the United States, it is my tremendous honor to finally wish America and the world, a very MERRY CHRISTMAS!
936351772603568130 Our FIFTH 1K milestone of 2017!
936339260218724353 Today, it was my great honor to meet with the Crown Prince of Bahrain at the @WhiteHouse. Bahrain and the United States are important partners. During the Crown Prince's visit, he is advancing $9 BILLION in commercial deals, including finalizing the purchase of F-16's...
936315571708289026 Thank you @SenOrrinHatch. Let's continue MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
936260193536573440 The Dow just broke 24,000 for the first time (another all-time Record). If the Dems had won the Presidential Election, the Market would be down 50% from these levels and Consumer Confidence, which is also at an all-time high, would be low and glum!
936219599422574592 Stock Market hits new Record High. Confidence and enthusiasm abound. More great numbers coming out!
936209447747190784 The Chinese Envoy, who just returned from North Korea, seems to have had no impact on Little Rocket Man. Hard to believe his people, and the military, put up with living in such horrible conditions. Russia and China condemned the launch.
936206961728786432 The Failing @nytimes has totally gone against the Social Media Guidelines that they installed to preserve some credibility after many of their biased reporters went Rogue! @foxandfriends
936203511037136897 The Failing @nytimes, the pipe organ for the Democrat Party, has become a virtual lobbyist for them with regard to our massive Tax Cut Bill. They are wrong so often that now I know we have a winner!
936058006659321858 Funny to hear the Democrats talking about the National Debt when President Obama doubled it in only 8 years!
936052257392676864 Had the information (Crooked Hillary's emails) been released there would have been harm to National Security.... Fmr Intel Comm Inspector General
936039501474025473 The only people who don't like the Tax Cut Bill are the people that don't understand it or the Obstructionist Democrats that know how really good it is and do not want the credit and success to go to the Republicans!
936037938898636800 The House of Representatives seeks contempt citations(?) against the JusticeDepartment and the FBI for withholding key documents and an FBI witness which could shed light on surveillance of associates of Donald Trump. Big stuff. Deep State. Give this information NOW! @FoxNews
936037588372283392 @Theresa_May, don't focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom. We are doing just fine!
936032830844555264 Theresa @theresamay, don't focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom. We are doing just fine!
936032275980079104 Now, we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to RESTORE AMERICAN PROSPERITY Ã¢ and RECLAIM AMERICA'S DESTINY. But in order to achieve this bright and glowing future, the SENATE MUST PASS TAX CUTS Ã¢ and bring Main Street roaring back to life!
936014271858831361 A vote to CUT TAXES is a vote to PUT AMERICA FIRST. It is time to take care of OUR WORKERS, to protect OUR COMMUNITIES, and to REBUILD OUR GREAT COUNTRY!
936005585019002887 This week, the Senate can join the House & take a strong stand for the Middle Class families who are the backbone of America. Together, we will give the American people a big, beautiful Christmas present-a massive tax cut that lets Americans keep more of their HARD-EARNED MONEY!
935940131311190021 Departing @JBA_NAFW for St. Charles, Missouri to help push our plan for HISTORIC TAX CUTS across the finish line. A successful vote in the Senate this week will bring us one giant step closer to delivering an incredible victory for the American people!
935883355547160577 Economy growing! Excluding hurricane effects, CEA estimates that real GDP growth would have been 3.9% in Q3. Stock market at a new high, unemployment at a low. We are winning and TAX CUTS will shift our economy into high gear!
935881037254725632 Just spoke to President XI JINPING of China concerning the provocative actions of North Korea. Additional major sanctions will be imposed on North Korea today. This situation will be handled!
935874566701842434 So now that Matt Lauer is gone when will the Fake News practitioners at NBC be terminating the contract of Phil Griffin? And will they terminate low ratings Joe Scarborough based on the unsolved mystery that took place in Florida years ago? Investigate!
935870484146683904 So now tha Matt Lauer is gone when will the Fake News practitioners at NBC be terminating the contract of Phil Griffin? And will they terminate low ratings Joe Scarborough based on the unsolved mystery that took place in Florida years ago? Investigate!
935844881825763328 Wow, Matt Lauer was just fired from NBC for inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace. But when will the top executives at NBC & Comcast be fired for putting out so much Fake News. Check out Andy Lack's past!
935841679977910272 Looks like another great day for the Stock Market. Consumer Confidence is at Record High. I guess somebody likes me (my policies)!
935838073618870272 Great, and we should boycott Fake News CNN. Dealing with them is a total waste of time!
935833914761007114 @foxandfriends, we are in record territory in all things having to do with our economy!
935713791765110785 Great day for Tax Cuts and the Republican Party. But the biggest Winner will be our great Country!
935712056690577414 Just won the lawsuit on leadership of Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, CFPB. A big win for the Consumer!
935701139198181376 Charles McCullough, the respected fmr Intel Comm Inspector General, said public was misled on Crooked Hillary Emails. Emails endangered National Security. Why aren't our deep State authorities looking at this? Rigged & corrupt? @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity
935686205429157888 After North Korea missile launch, it's more important than ever to fund our gov't & military! Dems shouldn't hold troop funding hostage for amnesty & illegal immigration. I ran on stopping illegal immigration and won big. They can't now threaten a shutdown to get their demands.
935640578007687168 The Conference Board said that consumer sentiment was at its highest level in nearly 17 years in November. The Consumer Confidence Index rose from 126.2 in October to 129.5, notching its best reading since December 2000...
935636972252618753 Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all finished the day at new RECORD HIGHS!

935545697360891904 Statement from President Donald J. Trump on #GivingTuesday
935513049729028096 Meeting with Chuck and Nancy today about keeping government open and working. Problem is they want illegal immigrants flooding into our Country unchecked, are weak on Crime and want to substantially RAISE Taxes. I don't see a deal!
935493619204620288 Melania, our great and very hard working First Lady, who truly loves what she is doing, always thought that if you run, you will win. She would tell everyone that, no doubt, he will win. I also felt I would win (or I would not have run) - and Country is doing great!
935489831005810688 At least 24 players kneeling this weekend at NFL stadiums that are now having a very hard time filling up. The American public is fed up with the disrespect the NFL is paying to our Country, our Flag and our National Anthem. Weak and out of control!
935339687006429185 New home sales reach a 10 year high. Stock Market has more record gains. Hopefully Republican Senators will give us the much needed Tax Cuts to keep it all going! Democrats want big Tax Increases.
935152378747195392 The Tax Cut Bill is coming along very well, great support. With just a few changes, some mathematical, the middle class and job producers can get even more in actual dollars and savings and the pass through provision becomes simpler and really works well!
935150368207654912 The good news is that their ratings are terrible, nobody cares!
935147410472480769 We should have a contest as to which of the Networks, plus CNN and not including Fox, is the most dishonest, corrupt and/or distorted in its political coverage of your favorite President (me). They are all bad. Winner to receive the FAKE NEWS TROPHY!
934961858380955648 Back in D.C., big week for Tax Cuts and many other things of great importance to our Country. Senate Republicans will hopefully come through for all of us. The Tax Cut Bill is getting better and better. The end result will be great for ALL!
934896989539586054 Since the first day I took office, all you hear is the phony Democrat excuse for losing the election, Russia, Russia,Russia. Despite this I have the economy booming and have possibly done more than any 10 month President. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
934792302341521408 I endorsed Luther Strange in the Alabama Primary. He shot way up in the polls but it wasn't enough. Can't let Schumer/Pelosi win this race. Liberal Jones would be BAD!
934781939088629761 The last thing we need in Alabama and the U.S. Senate is a Schumer/Pelosi puppet who is WEAK on Crime, WEAK on the Border, Bad for our Military and our great Vets, Bad for our 2nd Amendment, AND WANTS TO RAISES TAXES TO THE SKY. Jones would be a disaster!
934563828834164739 Wow, even I didn't realize we did so much. Wish the Fake News would report! Thank you.
934551607596986368 @FoxNews is MUCH more important in the United States than CNN, but outside of the U.S., CNN International is still a major source of (Fake) news, and they represent our Nation to the WORLD very poorly. The outside world does not see the truth from them!
934542257222451206 Check out the recent Editorial in the Wall Street Journal @WSJ about what a complete disaster the @CFPB has been under its leader from previous Administration, who just quit!
934539256940417024 The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, has been a total disaster as run by the previous Administrations pick. Financial Institutions have been devastated and unable to properly serve the public. We will bring it back to life!
934507210385829888 A great day to support your community and America's JOB creators by shopping locally at a #SmallBiz. #ShopSmall
934189999045693441 Time Magazine called to say that I was PROBABLY going to be named Man (Person) of the Year, like last year, but I would have to agree to an interview and a major photo shoot. I said probably is no good and took a pass. Thanks anyway!
934131805409697792 Will be calling the President of Egypt in a short while to discuss the tragic terrorist attack, with so much loss of life. We have to get TOUGHER AND SMARTER than ever before, and we will. Need the WALL, need the BAN! God bless the people of Egypt.
934080974773776384 Horrible and cowardly terrorist attack on innocent and defenseless worshipers in Egypt. The world cannot tolerate terrorism, we must defeat them militarily and discredit the extremist ideology that forms the basis of their existence!
934031535757582336 After Turkey call I will be heading over to Trump National Golf Club, Jupiter, to play golf (quickly) with Tiger Woods and Dustin Johnson. Then back to Mar-a-Lago for talks on bringing even more jobs and companies back to the USA!
934029886842458112 Will be speaking to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey this morning about bringing peace to the mess that I inherited in the Middle East. I will get it all done, but what a mistake, in lives and dollars (6 trillion), to be there in the first place!
934026050388013056 Can you believe that the disrespect for our Country, our Flag, our Anthem continues without penalty to the players. The Commissioner has lost control of the hemorrhaging league. Players are the boss!
933918671503753216 A great guy (with great ratings)!
933837062293291008 ObamaCare premiums are going up, up, up, just as I have been predicting for two years. ObamaCare is OWNED by the Democrats, and it is a disaster. But do not worry. Even though the Dems want to Obstruct, we will Repeal & Replace right after Tax Cuts!
933831194558582784 My great honor to join our incredible men and women of the @USCG, at the Lake Worth Inlet Station, in Riviera Beach, Florida today!
933692459351265280 Will be doing a live Thanksgiving Video Teleconference with Members of the Military at 9:00 A.M. Afghanistan, Iraq, USS Monterey, Turkey & Bahrain. Then going to Coast Guard Quarters, Florida.
933662564587855877 MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
933659179348299776 @ThePlumLineGS MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
933658521828315136 HAPPY THANKSGIVING, your Country is starting to do really well. Jobs coming back, highest Stock Market EVER, Military getting really strong, we will build the WALL, V.A. taking care of our Vets, great Supreme Court Justice, RECORD CUT IN REGS, lowest unemployment in 17 years....!
933517194142584833 ....And it will get even better with Tax Cuts!
933448074348900354 I have long given the order to help Argentina with the Search and Rescue mission of their missing submarine. 45 people aboard and not much time left. May God be with them and the people of Argentina!
933446283632824321 51 Million American to travel this weekend - highest number in twelve years (AAA). Traffic and airports are running very smoothly! @FoxNews
933319309551685633 The @USNavy is conducting search and rescue following aircraft crash. We are monitoring the situation. Prayers for all involved.
933301876975718401 Will be having meetings and working the phones from the Winter White House in Florida (Mar-a-Lago). Stock Market hit new Record High yesterday - $5.5 trillion gain since E. Many companies coming back to the U.S. Military building up and getting very strong.
933291075342540800 Another Crooked Hillary Fan!
933285973277868032 The NFL is now thinking about a new idea - keeping teams in the Locker Room during the National Anthem next season. That's almost as bad as kneeling! When will the highly paid Commissioner finally get tough and smart? This issue is killing your league!.....
933282274937733126 ...LaVar, you could have spent the next 5 to 10 years during Thanksgiving with your son in China, but no NBA contract to support you. But remember LaVar, shoplifting is NOT a little thing. It's a really big deal, especially in China. Ungrateful fool!
933280234220134401 It wasn't the White House, it wasn't the State Department, it wasn't father LaVar's so-called people on the ground in China that got his son out of a long term prison sentence - IT WAS ME. Too bad! LaVar is just a poor man's version of Don King, but without the hair. Just think..
933105158275325952 Today, we continued a wonderful American Tradition at the White House. Drumstick and Wishbone will live out their days in the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains at Gobbler's Rest...
933038654171344896 President Donald J. Trump and @FLOTUS Melania Participate in the Pardoning of the National Thanksgiving Turkey at the White House.
932578255810498560 Under President Trump unemployment rate will drop below 4%. Analysts predict economic boom for 2018! @foxandfriends and @Varneyco
932570628451954688 Marshawn Lynch of the NFL's Oakland Raiders stands for the Mexican Anthem and sits down to boos for our National Anthem. Great disrespect! Next time NFL should suspend him for remainder of season. Attendance and ratings way down.
932433668068528131 Republican Senators are working very hard to get Tax Cuts and Tax Reform approved. Hopefully it will not be long and they do not want to disappoint the American public!
932420488642617344 Border Patrol Officer killed at Southern Border, another badly hurt. We will seek out and bring to justice those responsible. We will, and must, build the Wall!
932397369655808001 Big-game trophy decision will be announced next week but will be very hard pressed to change my mind that this horror show in any way helps conservation of Elephants or any other animal.
932392209445457920 Shoplifting is a very big deal in China, as it should be (5-10 years in jail), but not to father LaVar. Should have gotten his son out during my next trip to China instead. China told them why they were released. Very ungrateful!
932388590344196096 Sen. Jeff Flake(y), who is unelectable in the Great State of Arizona (quit race, anemic polls) was caught (purposely) on mike saying bad things about your favorite President. He'll be a NO on tax cuts because his political career anyway is toast.
932303108146892801 Now that the three basketball players are out of China and saved from years in jail, LaVar Ball, the father of LiAngelo, is unaccepting of what I did for his son and that shoplifting is no big deal. I should have left them in jail!
931877599034388480 Crooked Hillary Clinton is the worst (and biggest) loser of all time. She just can't stop, which is so good for the Republican Party. Hillary, get on with your life and give it another try in three years!

929509950811881472 Does the Fake News Media remember when Crooked Hillary Clinton, as Secretary of State, was begging Russia to be our friend with the misspelled reset button? Obama tried also, but he had zero chemistry with Putin.
929503641014112256 When will all the haters and fools out there realize that having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. There always playing politics - bad for our country. I want to solve North Korea, Syria, Ukraine, terrorism, and Russia can greatly help!

918201878479073280 Happy to announce we are awarding $1M to Las Vegas - in order to help local law enforcement working OT to respond to last Sunday's tragedy.
918112884630093825 With all of the Fake News coming out of NBC and the Networks, at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License? Bad for country!
918110279367643137 Fake @NBCNews made up a story that I wanted a tenfold increase in our U.S. nuclear arsenal. Pure fiction, made up to demean. NBC = CNN!
918065431939829760 It is about time that Roger Goodell of the NFL is finally demanding that all players STAND for our great National Anthem-RESPECT OUR COUNTRY
918062778522505216 The Democrats want MASSIVE tax increases & soft, crime producing borders.The Republicans want the biggest tax cut in history & the WALL!
918061437750267904 It would be really nice if the Fake News Media would report the virtually unprecedented Stock Market growth since the election.Need tax cuts
918060313748164608 ...if Congress gives us the massive tax cuts (and reform) I am asking for, those numbers will grow by leaps and bounds. #MAGA
918058910673760258 Stock Market has increased by 5.2 Trillion dollars since the election on November 8th, a 25% increase. Lowest unemployment in 16 years and..
917923131003719681 ...fired. This story is totally made up by the dishonest media.The Chief is doing a FANTASTIC job for me and, more importantly, for the USA!
917921548677328896 The Fake News is at it again, this time trying to hurt one of the finest people I know, General John Kelly, by saying he will soon be.....
917894963832246272 My great honor to host the 2017 back-to-back #StanleyCup Champion Pittsburgh Penguins at the WH with @FLOTUS today!
917734186848579584 The Failing @nytimes set Liddle' Bob Corker up by recording his conversation. Was made to sound a fool, and that's what I am dealing with!
917724872905777155 Highly respected author, Christopher Bedford, just came out with book, The Art of the Donald, Lessons from America's.... Really good book!
917701841466593280 With Jemele Hill at the mike, it is no wonder ESPN ratings have tanked, in fact, tanked so badly it is the talk of the industry!
917698839846576130 Since Congress can't get its act together on HealthCare, I will be using the power of the pen to give great HealthCare to many people - FAST
917695847063805952 The problem with agreeing to a policy on immigration is that the Democrats don't want secure borders,they don't care about safety for U.S.A.
917694644481413120 Why is the NFL getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our Anthem, Flag and Country? Change tax law!
917578120819068928 We have just begun!
917568245854605313 A big salute to Jerry Jones, owner of the Dallas Cowboys, who will BENCH players who disrespect our Flag.Stand for Anthem or sit for game!
917458408927842305 President Donald J. Trump Proclaims October 9, 2017, as #ColumbusDay
917345200414035969 The trip by @VP Pence was long planned. He is receiving great praise for leaving game after the players showed such disrespect for country!
917341511754436609 Our country has been unsuccessfully dealing with North Korea for 25 years, giving billions of dollars & getting nothing. Policy didn't work!
917177470532636672 The Republican Party is racking up record amounts of small dollar donations - fueled by Trump supporters..... @nypost Thank you!
917172144710103040 Nobody could have done what I've done for #PuertoRico with so little appreciation. So much work!
917130468025348096 Bob Corker gave us the Iran Deal, & that's about it. We need HealthCare, we need Tax Cuts/Reform, we need people that can get the job done!
917114761057357824 FEMA and first responders are working hard (yet again) on Hurricane Nate. Military helping. Very much under control!
917091286607433728 I asked @VP Pence to leave stadium if any players kneeled, disrespecting our country. I am proud of him and @SecondLady Karen.
917030148867682304 ...Hence, I would fully expect Corker to be a negative voice and stand in the way of our great agenda. Didn't have the guts to run!
917029060471152640 ..my endorsement). He also wanted to be Secretary of State, I said NO THANKS. He is also largely responsible for the horrendous Iran Deal!
917026789188399105 Senator Bob Corker begged me to endorse him for re-election in Tennessee. I said NO and he dropped out (said he could not win without...
916780428253687808 Leaving the White House for the Great State of North Carolina. Big progress being made on many fronts!
916763438805848066 Thanks for your support!
916751271960436737 ...hasn't worked, agreements violated before the ink was dry, makings fools of U.S. negotiators. Sorry, but only one thing will work!
916750042014404608 Presidents and their administrations have been talking to North Korea for 25 years, agreements made and massive amounts of money paid......
916747884716011521 Will be joining @GovMikeHuckabee tonight at 8pmE on @TBN. Enjoy!
916665576940097536 Our great team at @FEMA is prepared for #HurricaneNate. Everyone in LA, MS, AL, and FL please listen to your local authorities & be safe!
916655548623413248 @NBCNews is so knowingly inaccurate with their reporting. The good news is that the PEOPLE get it, which is really all that matters! Not #1
916638685914951680 I called Chuck Schumer yesterday to see if the Dems want to do a great HealthCare Bill. ObamaCare is badly broken, big premiums. Who knows!
916635236238274561 More and more people are suggesting that Republicans (and me) should be given Equal Time on T.V. when you look at the one-sided coverage?
916634286811435008 Late Night host are dealing with the Democrats for their very unfunny & repetitive material, always anti-Trump! Should we get Equal Time?
916622087606980609 ..ributions. The RNC is taking in far more $'s than the Dems, and much of it by my wonderful small donors. I am working hard for them!
916620603741868032 Can't believe I finally got a good story in the @washingtonpost. It discusses the enthusiasm of Trump voters through campaign....
916120435762266114 Ralph Northam,who is running for Governor of Virginia,is fighting for the violent MS-13 killer gangs & sanctuary cities. Vote Ed Gillespie!
915907150333009920 Rex Tillerson never threatened to resign. This is Fake News put out by @NBCNews. Low news and reporting standards. No verification from me.
915896809536589824 Stock Market hits an ALL-TIME high! Unemployment lowest in 16 years! Business and manufacturing enthusiasm at highest level in decades!
915894251967385600 Why Isn't the Senate Intel Committee looking into the Fake News Networks in OUR country to see why so much of our news is just made up-FAKE!
915890389269254145 So wonderful to be in Las Vegas yesterday and meet with people, from police to doctors to the victims themselves, who I will never forget!
915745470689005573 On behalf of a GRATEFUL NATION, THANK YOU to all of the First Responders (HEROES) who saved countless lives in Las Vegas on Sunday night.

915604746936967168 I will be landing in Las Vegas shortly to pay my respects with @FLOTUS Melania. Everyone remains in our thoughts and prayers.
915596990674849792 The @NBCNews story has just been totally refuted by Sec. Tillerson and @VP Pence. It is #FakeNews. They should issue an apology to AMERICA!
915589297096536065 NBC news is #FakeNews and more dishonest than even CNN. They are a disgrace to good reporting. No wonder their news ratings are way down!
915539424406114304 Wow, so many Fake News stories today. No matter what I do or say, they will not write or speak truth. The Fake News Media is out of control!
915523382686478337 A great day in Puerto Rico yesterday. While some of the news coverage is Fake, most showed great warmth and friendship.
915379231454003200 My Administration will continue to work around the clock with Governor @RicardoRossello & his team. Great progress being made! #PRStrongÃ°Å¸Ã°Å¸Â·
915371086249971712 It is a miracle how fast the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police were able to find the demented shooter and stop him from even more killing!
915351470354108417 So proud of @FEMA, Military, and First Responders! Thank you!
915335645719121920 Great meeting with Governor Mapp of the #USVI. He is very thankful for the great job done by @FEMA and First Responders.

914565910798782465 Being nice to Rocket Man hasn't worked in 25 years, why would it work now? Clinton failed, Bush failed, and Obama failed. I won't fail.
914497947517227008 ...Save your energy Rex, we'll do what has to be done!
914497877543735296 I told Rex Tillerson, our wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man...
914467502251528192 ...for safety. Thank you to the Governor of P.R. and to all of those who are working so closely with our First Responders. Fantastic job!
914466534365569025 ...people are now starting to recognize the amazing work that has been done by FEMA and our great Military. All buildings now inspected.....
914465475777695744 We have done a great job with the almost impossible situation in Puerto Rico. Outside of the Fake News or politically motivated ingrates,...
914310901855129601 19,000 RESPECTING our National Anthem! #StandForOurAnthemÃ°Å¸ÂºÃ°Å¸Â¸
914269704440737792 In analyzing the Alabama Primary race,FAKE NEWS always fails to mention that the candidate I endorsed went up MANY points after endorsement!
914267744345972737 In analyzing the Alabama Primary race, Fake News always fails to mention that the candidate I endorsed went up MANY points after Election!
914260261304860672 Because of #FakeNews my people are not getting the credit they deserve for doing a great job. As seen here, they are ALL doing a GREAT JOB!
914255264282480640 Very important that NFL players STAND tomorrow, and always, for the playing of our National Anthem. Respect our Flag and our Country!
914252271982178306 I will be in PR on Tues. to further ensure we continue doing everything possible to assist & support the people in their time of great need.
914227642131509248 Results of recovery efforts will speak much louder than complaints by San Juan Mayor. Doing everything we can to help great people of PR!
914217658517737472 We must all be united in offering assistance to everyone suffering in Puerto Rico and elsewhere in the wake of this terrible disaster.
914217477495717889 @ricardorossello ......#FakeNews critics are working overtime, but we're getting great marks from the people that truly matter!
914217117695795201 My Administration, Governor @RicardoRossello, and many others are working together to help the people of Puerto Rico in every way...
914216744385904640 To the people of Puerto Rico: Do not believe the #FakeNews!
914214237584674816 Congresswoman Jennifer Gonzalez-Colon of Puerto Rico has been wonderful to deal with and a great representative of the people. Thank you!
914210813237489666 Just spoke to Governor Kenneth Mapp of the U.S. Virgin Islands who stated that #FEMA and Military are doing a GREAT job! Thank you Governor!
914208123564494850 The Governor of Puerto Rico, Ricardo Rossello, is a great guy and leader who is really working hard. Thank you Ricky!
914189344533024768 Despite the Fake News Media in conjunction with the Dems, an amazing job is being done in Puerto Rico. Great people!
914099295963553792 The Fake News Networks are working overtime in Puerto Rico doing their best to take the spirit away from our soldiers and first R's. Shame!
914096428879933440 I will be going to Puerto Rico on Tuesday with Melania. Will hopefully be able to stop at the U.S. Virgin Islands (people working hard).
914094625488502784 Fake News CNN and NBC are going out of their way to disparage our great First Responders as a way to get Trump. Not fair to FR or effort!
914090947180470272 The military and first responders, despite no electric, roads, phones etc., have done an amazing job. Puerto Rico was totally destroyed.
914089888596754434 ...want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort. 10,000 Federal workers now on Island doing a fantastic job.
914089003745468417 ...Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help. They....
914087234869047296 The Mayor of San Juan, who was very complimentary only a few days ago, has now been told by the Democrats that you must be nasty to Trump.
913902084461916161 @IMPDnews @POTUS THANK YOU to the amazing Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department and all law enforcement officers, for all you do 24/7/365! #LESM
913892019847778305 Join me for my #WeeklyAddressÃ°Å¸ÂºÃ°Å¸Â¸

913724766208610304 ...The fact is that Puerto Rico has been destroyed by two hurricanes. Big decisions will have to be made as to the cost of its rebuilding!
913723771336392704 Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello just stated: The Administration and the President, every time we've spoken, they've delivered......
913589799411490817 GDP was revised upward to 3.1 for last quarter. Many people thought it would be years before that happened. We have just begun!
913554705816711168 Puerto Rico is devastated. Phone system, electric grid many roads, gone. FEMA and First Responders are amazing. Governor said great job!
913550237377138688 ...really hard to help but many have lost their homes. Military is now on site and I will be there Tuesday. Wish press would treat fairly!
913549374227181568 FEMA & First Responders are doing a GREAT job in Puerto Rico. Massive food & water delivered. Docks & electric grid dead. Locals trying....
913403237033742336 The electric power grid in Puerto Rico is totally shot. Large numbers of generators are now on Island. Food and water on site.
913371663789625344 Democrats don't want massive tax cuts - how does that win elections? Great reviews for Tax Cut and Reform Bill.
913220484640182272 It is time to take care of OUR people, to rebuild OUR NATION, and to fight for OUR GREAT AMERICAN WORKERS! #TaxReform #USAÃ°Å¸ÂºÃ°Å¸Â¸
913187235452690432 This is the right TAX CUT @ the RIGHT TIME. We will ALL succeed & grow TOGETHER Ã¢ as one team, one people, & one American family. #TaxReform
913117797231857664 Just arrived in Indianapolis, Indiana to make an announcement on #TaxReform! Together, we are going to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
913035855509491712 ..But the people were Pro-Trump! Virtually no President has accomplished what we have accomplished in the first 9 months-and economy roaring
913034591879024640 Facebook was always anti-Trump.The Networks were always anti-Trump hence,Fake News, @nytimes(apologized) & @WaPo were anti-Trump. Collusion?
913004378486984704 We will have the votes for Healthcare but not for the reconciliation deadline of Friday, after which we need 60. Get rid of Filibuster Rule!
913003340451188737 With one Yes vote in hospital & very positive signs from Alaska and two others (McCain is out), we have the HCare Vote, but not for Friday!
912997506900021248 Spoke to Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys yesterday. Jerry is a winner who knows how to get things done. Players will stand for Country!
912994446219898880 Spoke to Roy Moore of Alabama last night for the first time. Sounds like a really great guy who ran a fantastic race. He will help to #MAGA!

912670906828443648 ALABAMA, get out and vote for Luther Strange - he has proven to me that he will never let you down! #MAGA
912664574461120512 The NFL has all sorts of rules and regulations. The only way out for them is to set a rule that you can't kneel during our National Anthem!
912651215997202432 Thank you to Carmen Yulin Cruz, the Mayor of San Juan, for your kind words on FEMA etc.We are working hard. Much food and water there/on way
912636538156146688 Great interview on @foxandfriends with the parents of Otto Warmbier: 1994 - 2017. Otto was tortured beyond belief by North Korea.
912631781098221568 Luther Strange has been shooting up in the Alabama polls since my endorsement. Finish the job - vote today for Big Luther.
912629775629418501 But while Dallas dropped to its knees as a team, they all stood up for our National Anthem. Big progress being made-we all love our country!
912628271426269185 ...But while Dallas dropped to it knees as a team, they ALL stood up for our National Anthem. Big progress being made - we love our country!
912626731357540353 The booing at the NFL football game last night, when the entire Dallas team dropped to its knees, was loudest I have ever heard. Great anger
912624892239077376 Ratings for NFL football are way down except before game starts, when people tune in to see whether or not our country will be disrespected!
912494675206053888 Big election tomorrow in the Great State of Alabama. Vote for Senator Luther Strange, tough on crime & border - will never let you down!
912487929783754755 A few of the many clips of John McCain talking about Repealing & Replacing O'Care. My oh my has he changed-complete turn from years of talk!
912481556127780865 ...owed to Wall Street and the banks which, sadly, must be dealt with. Food, water and medical are top priorities - and doing well. #FEMA
912479500511965184 ...It's old electrical grid, which was in terrible shape, was devastated. Much of the Island was destroyed, with billions of dollars....
912478274508423168 Texas & Florida are doing great but Puerto Rico, which was already suffering from broken infrastructure & massive debt, is in deep trouble..
912443924979077120 Tremendous backlash against the NFL and its players for disrespect of our Country.
912443607084404736 General John Kelly totally agrees w/ my stance on NFL players and the fact that they should not be disrespecting our FLAG or GREAT COUNTRY!
912443217227976704 @CNN is #FakeNews. Just reported COS (John Kelly) was opposed to my stance on NFL players disrespecting FLAG, ANTHEM, COUNTRY. Total lie!
912281550712135680 The White House never looked more beautiful than it did returning last night. Important meetings taking place today. Big tax cuts & reform.
912280282224525312 The issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race. It is about respect for our Country, Flag and National Anthem. NFL must respect this!
912278438127525888 Many people booed the players who kneeled yesterday (which was a small percentage of total). These are fans who demand respect for our Flag!
912276850793213952 So proud of NASCAR and its supporters and fans. They won't put up with disrespecting our Country or our Flag - they said it loud and clear!
912101775221706752 Making America Safe is my number one priority. We will not admit those into our country we cannot safely vet.
912080538755846144 Sports fans should never condone players that do not stand proud for their National Anthem or their Country. NFL should change policy!
912079629648883712 Alaska, Arizona, Maine and Kentucky are big winners in the Healthcare proposal. 7 years of Repeal & Replace and some Senators not there.
912037003923005440 Courageous Patriots have fought and died for our great American Flag --- we MUST honor and respect it! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
912019957243883520 Please to inform that the Champion Pittsburgh Penguins of the NHL will be joining me at the White House for Ceremony. Great team!
912018945158402049 Great solidarity for our National Anthem and for our Country. Standing with locked arms is good, kneeling is not acceptable. Bad ratings!
911911385176723457 ...NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. League should back U.S.
911904261553950720 If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag & Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!
911789314169823232 Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at U.N. If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won't be around much longer!
911718138747727872 Roger Goodell of NFL just put out a statement trying to justify the total disrespect certain players show to our country.Tell them to stand!
911717004222091264 Democrats are laughingly saying that McCain had a moment of courage. Tell that to the people of Arizona who were deceived. 116% increase!
911711539815702529 Iran just test-fired a Ballistic Missile capable of reaching Israel.They are also working with North Korea.Not much of an agreement we have!
911700914997792769 Very proud of our incredible First Lady (@FLOTUS.) She is a truly great representative for our country!
911655987857281024 ...our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem. If not, YOU'RE FIRED. Find something else to do!
911654184918880260 If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL,or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect....
911572182060453893 Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team.Stephen Curry is hesitating,therefore invitation is withdrawn!
911549980946714624 It was great being with Luther Strange last night in Alabama. What great people, what a crowd! Vote Luther on Tuesday.
911549099752804357 Alaska had a 200% plus increase in premiums under ObamaCare, worst in the country. Deductibles high, people angry! Lisa M comes through.
911546774267006976 I know Rand Paul and I think he may find a way to get there for the good of the Party!
911545480651378689 Large Block Grants to States is a good thing to do. Better control & management. Great for Arizona. McCain let his best friend L.G. down!
911543222731706368 Arizona had a 116% increase in ObamaCare premiums last year, with deductibles very high. Chuck Schumer sold John McCain a bill of goods. Sad
911541328013676544 John McCain never had any intention of voting for this Bill, which his Governor loves. He campaigned on Repeal & Replace. Let Arizona down!
911338971250216960 Heading to Alabama now, big crowd!
911287725847908352 Thank you to Doug Parker and American Airlines for all of the help you have given to the U.S. with Hurricane flights. Fantastic job!

911189860769255424 The greatest influence over our election was the Fake News Media screaming for Crooked Hillary Clinton. Next, she was a bad candidate!
911179462745710593 The Russia hoax continues, now it's ads on Facebook. What about the totally biased and dishonest Media coverage in favor of Crooked Hillary?
911175246853664768 Kim Jong Un of North Korea, who is obviously a madman who doesn't mind starving or killing his people, will be tested like never before!
911173124976193536 Rand Paul, or whoever votes against Hcare Bill, will forever (future political campaigns) be known as the Republican who saved ObamaCare.
910993665568526337 A big day for the U.S. at the United Nations!
910992971620864004 Senator Luther Strange has gone up a lot in the polls since I endorsed him a month ago. Now a close runoff. He will be great in D.C.

910665452048838661 The NRA strongly endorses Luther Strange for Senator of Alabama.That means all gun owners should vote for Big Luther. He won't let you down!
910641701064204288 I would not sign Graham-Cassidy if it did not include coverage of pre-existing conditions. It does! A great Bill. Repeal & Replace.
910635327672512512 Alabama is sooo lucky to have a candidate like Big Luther Strange. Smart, tough on crime, borders & trade, loves Vets & Military. Tuesday!

910477734635286528 I hope Republican Senators will vote for Graham-Cassidy and fulfill their promise to Repeal & Replace ObamaCare. Money direct to States!
910476107287269376 Rand Paul is a friend of mine but he is such a negative force when it comes to fixing healthcare. Graham-Cassidy Bill is GREAT! Ends Ocare!

910219338044657664 As President of the United States of America, I will ALWAYS put #AmericaFirstÃ°Å¸ÂºÃ°Å¸Â¸#UNGA

908645126146265090 The travel ban into the United States should be far larger, tougher and more specific-but stupidly, that would not be politically correct!
908643633901039617 Loser terrorists must be dealt with in a much tougher manner.The internet is their main recruitment tool which we must cut off & use better!
908642277987356673 Another attack in London by a loser terrorist.These are sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard. Must be proactive!
908640949605163010 With the ridiculous Filibuster Rule in the Senate, Republicans need 60 votes to pass legislation, rather than 51. Can't get votes, END NOW!

904309527381716992 South Korea is finding, as I have told them, that their talk of appeasement with North Korea will not work, they only understand one thing!
904307898213433344 ..North Korea is a rogue nation which has become a great threat and embarrassment to China, which is trying to help but with little success.
904305644651634688 North Korea has conducted a major Nuclear Test. Their words and actions continue to be very hostile and dangerous to the United States.....

900708110330978304 James Clapper, who famously got caught lying to Congress, is now an authority on Donald Trump. Will he show you his beautiful letter to me?

898964640817983488 Steve Bannon will be a tough and smart new voice at @BreitbartNews...maybe even better than ever before. Fake News needs the competition!

898136462385979392 Great to see that Dr. Kelli Ward is running against Flake Jeff Flake, who is WEAK on borders, crime and a non-factor in Senate. He's toxic!
898130328916824064 The public is learning (even more so) how dishonest the Fake News is. They totally misrepresent what I say about hate, bigotry etc. Shame!
898128290698989568 ...and people like Ms. Heyer. Such a disgusting lie. He just can't forget his election trouncing.The people of South Carolina will remember!
898127175525728256 Publicity seeking Lindsey Graham falsely stated that I said there is moral equivalency between the KKK, neo-Nazis & white supremacists......

897784898865553409 Kim Jong Un of North Korea made a very wise and well reasoned decision. The alternative would have been both catastrophic and unacceptable!
897764432369070080 Congratulation to Roy Moore and Luther Strange for being the final two and heading into a September runoff in Alabama. Exciting race!
897763049226084352 Amazon is doing great damage to tax paying retailers. Towns, cities and states throughout the U.S. are being hurt - many jobs being lost!
897478270442143744 For every CEO that drops out of the Manufacturing Council, I have many to take their place. Grandstanders should not have gone on. JOBS!

897079051277537280 Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council,he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!
897048688639574016 The Obstructionist Democrats have given us (or not fixed) some of the worst trade deals in World History. I am changing that fast!
897044700124909569 Luther Strange of the Great State of Alabama has my endorsement. He is strong on Border & Wall, the military, tax cuts & law enforcement.

895599179522650112 Can you believe that Mitch McConnell, who has screamed Repeal & Replace for 7 years, couldn't get it done. Must Repeal & Replace ObamaCare!
895347654431035393 Senator Mitch McConnell said I had excessive expectations, but I don't think so. After 7 years of hearing Repeal & Replace, why not done?
895254168570605568 ...Hopefully we will never have to use this power, but there will never be a time that we are not the most powerful nation in the world!

894880193839497216 After many years of failure,countries are coming together to finally address the dangers posed by North Korea. We must be tough & decisive!
894878812063846400 I will be holding a major briefing on the Opioid crisis, a major problem for our country, today at 3:00 P.M. in Bedminster, N.J.
894661651760377856 I think Senator Blumenthal should take a nice long vacation in Vietnam, where he lied about his service, so he can at least say he was there
894659355324424192 How much longer will the failing nytimes, with its big losses and massive unfunded liability (and non-existent sources), remain in business?
894653195112378368 The Fake News Media will not talk about the importance of the United Nations Security Council's 15-0 vote in favor of sanctions on N. Korea!
894620077634592769 On #PurpleHeartDayÃ°Å¸ÅI thank all the brave men and women who have sacrificed in battle for this GREAT NATION! #USAÃ°Å¸ÂºÃ°Å¸Â¸

894521737534197762 Working hard from New Jersey while White House goes through long planned renovation. Going to New York next week for more meetings.
894518002795900928 Hard to believe that with 24/7 #Fake News on CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, NYTIMES & WAPO, the Trump base is getting stronger!
894515865802223616 ... Supreme Court pick, economic enthusiasm, deregulation & so much more have driven the Trump base even closer together. Will never change!
894514535062790144 ...and West Virginia. The fact is the Fake News Russian collusion story, record Stock Market, border security, military strength, jobs.....
894512983384129536 The Trump base is far bigger & stronger than ever before (despite some phony Fake News polling). Look at rallies in Penn, Iowa, Ohio.......
894508048844279809 The failing @nytimes, which has made every wrong prediction about me including my big election win (apologized), is totally inept!
894368024765059073 Just completed call with President Moon of South Korea. Very happy and impressed with 15-0 United Nations vote on North Korea sanctions.

891996053611917312 If ObamaCare is hurting people, & it is, why shouldn't it hurt the insurance companies & why should Congress not be paying what public pays?
891623821702295552 Don't give up Republican Senators, the World is watching: Repeal & Replace...and go to 51 votes (nuke option), get Cross State Lines & more.
891442016294494209 ...they do NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk. We will no longer allow this to continue. China could easily solve this problem!
891440474132795392 I am very disappointed in China. Our foolish past leaders have allowed them to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year in trade, yet...
891437168798965761 I love reading about all of the geniuses who were so instrumental in my election success. Problem is, most don't exist. #Fake News! MAGA
891397134662193152 Unless the Republican Senators are total quitters, Repeal & Replace is not dead! Demand another vote before voting on any other bill!

891263843908947969 If the Senate Democrats ever got the chance, they would switch to a 51 majority vote in first minute. They are laughing at R's. MAKE CHANGE!
891261878005092353 ....8 Dems totally control the U.S. Senate. Many great Republican bills will never pass, like Kate's Law and complete Healthcare. Get smart!
891260230876659713 Republicans in the Senate will NEVER win if they don't go to a 51 vote majority NOW. They look like fools and are just wasting time......
891259245106278400 The very outdated filibuster rule must go. Budget reconciliation is killing R's in Senate. Mitch M, go to 51 Votes NOW and WIN. IT'S TIME!
891257113565163520 Republican Senate must get rid of 60 vote NOW! It is killing the R Party, allows 8 Dems to control country. 200 Bills sit in Senate. A JOKE!
891253798500487168 In other words, Russia was against Trump in the 2016 Election - and why not, I want strong military & low oil prices. Witch Hunt!

890935044474380288 ...Even though parts of healthcare could pass at 51, some really good things need 60. So many great future bills & budgets need 60 votes....
890931465885798400 If Republicans are going to pass great future legislation in the Senate, they must immediately go to a 51 vote majority, not senseless 60...
890820505330212864 3 Republicans and 48 Democrats let the American people down. As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal. Watch!
890764622852173826 Go Republican Senators, Go! Get there after waiting for 7 years. Give America great healthcare!

889796918615920640 ObamaCare is torturing the American People.The Democrats have fooled the people long enough. Repeal or Repeal & Replace! I have pen in hand.
889794300913045508 Big day for HealthCare. After 7 years of talking, we will soon see whether or not Republicans are willing to step up to the plate!
889792764363276288 Problem is that the acting head of the FBI & the person in charge of the Hillary investigation, Andrew McCabe, got $700,000 from H for wife!
889790429398528000 Attorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are E-mails & DNC server) & Intel leakers!
889788202172780544 Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump campaign - quietly working to boost Clinton. So where is the investigation A.G. @seanhannity
889675644396867584 Is Fake News Washington Post being used as a lobbyist weapon against Congress to keep Politicians from looking into Amazon no-tax monopoly?
889673743873843200 So many stories about me in the @washingtonpost are Fake News. They are as bad as ratings challenged @CNN. Lobbyist for Amazon and taxes?
889672374458646528 The Amazon Washington Post fabricated the facts on my ending massive, dangerous, and wasteful payments to Syrian rebels fighting Assad.....
889654862379589633 #2017Jambo- Remember your duty. Honor your history. Take care of the people God puts into your life Ã¢ and LOVE & CHERISH your country!

889579795176181761 Arriving at Joint Base Andrews with @SecretaryPerry, @SecretaryZinke, and @SecPriceMD.....
889474780356915206 Republicans have a last chance to do the right thing on Repeal & Replace after years of talking & campaigning on it.
889473486506385409 Sleazy Adam Schiff, the totally biased Congressman looking into Russia, spends all of his time on television pushing the Dem loss excuse!
889467610332528641 So why aren't the Committees and investigators, and of course our beleaguered A.G., looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes & Russia relations?
889438168721874944 After 1 year of investigation with Zero evidence being found, Chuck Schumer just stated that Democrats should blame ourselves,not Russia.
889435104841523201 Drain the Swamp should be changed to Drain the Sewer - it's actually much worse than anyone ever thought, and it begins with the Fake News!
889279880336166914 Thank you to @LOUDOBBS for giving the first six months of the Trump Administration an A+. S.C.,reg cutting,Stock M, jobs,border etc. = TRUE!
889274373689028609 If Republicans don't Repeal and Replace the disastrous ObamaCare, the repercussions will be far greater than any of them understand!
889273320574783489 It's hard to read the Failing New York Times or the Amazon Washington Post because every story/opinion, even if should be positive, is bad!
889217183930351621 It's very sad that Republicans, even some that were carried over the line on my back, do very little to protect their President.
889215815022727168 As the phony Russian Witch Hunt continues, two groups are laughing at this excuse for a lost election taking hold, Democrats and Russians!
888924192573235201 To every PATRIOT who will serve on the #USSGeraldRFord: Good Luck & Godspeed!

888736256145985536 ObamaCare is dead and the Democrats are obstructionists, no ideas or votes, only obstruction. It is solely up to the 52 Republican Senators!
888734848550043648 The Republican Senators must step up to the plate and, after 7 years, vote to Repeal and Replace. Next, Tax Reform and Infrastructure. WIN!
888733031875346432 In all fairness to Anthony Scaramucci, he wanted to endorse me 1st, before the Republican Primaries started, but didn't think I was running!
888730468732067841 My son Donald openly gave his e-mails to the media & authorities whereas Crooked Hillary Clinton deleted (& acid washed) her 33,000 e-mails!
888727293346156546 ...What about all of the Clinton ties to Russia, including Podesta Company, Uranium deal, Russian Reset, big dollar speeches etc.
888726438265966592 So many people are asking why isn't the A.G. or Special Council looking at the many Hillary Clinton or Comey crimes. 33,000 e-mails deleted?
888724194820857857 While all agree the U. S. President has the complete power to pardon, why think of that when only crime so far is LEAKS against us.FAKE NEWS
888713231065391104 This morning I will be going to the Commissioning Ceremony for the largest aircraft carrier in the world, The Gerald R. Ford. Norfolk, Va.
888711488717934592 The Failing New York Times foiled U.S. attempt to kill the single most wanted terrorist,Al-Baghdadi.Their sick agenda over National Security
888708453560184832 A new INTELLIGENCE LEAK from the Amazon Washington Post,this time against A.G. Jeff Sessions.These illegal leaks, like Comey's, must stop!
888575966259314691 Sean Spicer is a wonderful person who took tremendous abuse from the Fake News Media - but his future is bright!

887862941109940225 Melania and I send our thoughts and prayers to Senator McCain, Cindy, and their entire family. Get well soon.
887654816507408384 The Republicans never discuss how good their healthcare bill is, & it will get even better at lunchtime.The Dems scream death as OCare dies!
887650824515661824 I will be having lunch at the White House today with Republican Senators concerning healthcare. They MUST keep their promise to America!
887477071160762369 The Fake News is becoming more and more dishonest! Even a dinner arranged for top 20 leaders in Germany is made to look sinister!
887475373981696000 Fake News story of secret dinner with Putin is sick. All G 20 leaders, and spouses, were invited by the Chancellor of Germany. Press knew!
887302632687251456 The Senate must go to a 51 vote majority instead of current 60 votes. Even parts of full Repeal need 60. 8 Dems control Senate. Crazy!
887299895803203584 With only a very small majority, the Republicans in the House & Senate need more victories next year since Dems totally obstruct, no votes!
887280380423938048 As I have always said, let ObamaCare fail and then come together and do a great healthcare plan. Stay tuned!
887279050263285761 We were let down by all of the Democrats and a few Republicans. Most Republicans were loyal, terrific & worked really hard. We will return!
887134287350439936 Republicans should just REPEAL failing ObamaCare now & work on a new Healthcare Plan that will start from a clean slate. Dems will join in!
886950594220568576 Most politicians would have gone to a meeting like the one Don jr attended in order to get info on an opponent. That's politics!
886743367815766021 Heading back to Washington, D.C. Much will be accomplished this week on trade, the military and security!
886742955251335168 Congratulations to Sung Hyun Park on winning the 2017 @USGA #USWomensOpenÃ°Å¸ÂºÃ°Å¸Â¸

886588838902206464 The ABC/Washington Post Poll, even though almost 40% is not bad at this time, was just about the most inaccurate poll around election time!
886544734788997125 With all of its phony unnamed sources & highly slanted & even fraudulent reporting, #Fake News is DISTORTING DEMOCRACY in our country!
886541955311816705 Thank you to former campaign adviser Michael Caputo for saying so powerfully that there was no Russian collusion in our winning campaign.
886538703547621376 Thank you to all of the supporters, who far out-numbered the protesters, yesterday at the Women's U.S. Open. Very cool!

885131482397908992 The W.H. is functioning perfectly, focused on HealthCare, Tax Cuts/Reform & many other things. I have very little time for watching T.V.
885128373441355777 Why aren't the same standards placed on the Democrats. Look what Hillary Clinton may have gotten away with. Disgraceful!
885109663217352704 @WashTimes states Democrats have willfully used Moscow disinformation to influence the presidential election against Donald Trump.

880017678978736129 Some of the Fake News Media likes to say that I am not totally engaged in healthcare. Wrong, I know the subject well & want victory for U.S.
880015261004435456 The failing @nytimes writes false story after false story about me. They don't even call to verify the facts of a story. A Fake News Joke!
879828637733793793 I just finished a great meeting with the Republican Senators concerning HealthCare. They really want to get it right, unlike OCare!
879827411008974852 With ZERO Democrats to help, and a failed, expensive and dangerous ObamaCare as the Dems legacy, the Republican Senators are working hard!
879682547235651584 So they caught Fake News CNN cold, but what about NBC, CBS & ABC? What about the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost? They are all Fake News!
879678356450676736 Fake News CNN is looking at big management changes now that they got caught falsely pushing their phony Russian stories. Ratings way down!
879648931172556802 Wow, CNN had to retract big story on Russia, with 3 employees forced to resign. What about all the other phony stories they do? FAKE NEWS!

879326984794517507 Republican Senators are working very hard to get there, with no help from the Democrats. Not easy! Perhaps just let OCare crash & burn!
879324620159160322 ..under a magnifying glass, they have zero tapes of T people colluding. There is no collusion & no obstruction. I should be given apology!
879323238425395200 The real story is that President Obama did NOTHING after being informed in August about Russian meddling. With 4 months looking at Russia...
879320905608044544 ...and did not want to rock the boat. He didn't choke, he colluded or obstructed, and it did the Dems and Crooked Hillary no good.
879317636164841474 The reason that President Obama did NOTHING about Russia after being notified by the CIA of meddling is that he expected Clinton would win..
879315860178993152 The Democrats have become nothing but OBSTRUCTIONISTS, they have no policies or ideas. All they do is delay and complain.They own ObamaCare!

875321478849363968 You are witnessing the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history - led by some very bad and conflicted people! #MAGA
875305788708974592 They made up a phony collusion with the Russians story, found zero proof, so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story. Nice

817703208567078913 Only reason the hacking of the poorly defended DNC is discussed is that the loss by the Dems was so big that they are totally embarrassed!
817701436096126977 Intelligence stated very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results. Voting machines not touched!

810996052241293312 We did it! Thank you to all of my great supporters, we just officially won the election (despite all of the distorted and inaccurate media).
810988379051610112 Today there were terror attacks in Turkey, Switzerland and Germany - and it is only getting worse. The civilized world must change thinking!
810604216771284992 If my many supporters acted and threatened people like those who lost the election are doing, they would be scorned & called terrible names!

808653723639697408 The thing I like best about Rex Tillerson is that he has vast experience at dealing successfully with all types of foreign governments.
808642018612310016 Wisconsin and Pennsylvania have just certified my wins in those states. I actually picked up additional votes!
808638507161882624 I have chosen one of the truly great business leaders of the world, Rex Tillerson, Chairman and CEO of ExxonMobil, to be Secretary of State.
808532286664822784 I will hold a press conference in the near future to discuss the business, Cabinet picks and all other topics of interest. Busy times!

808469755749339136 I will be making my announcement on the next Secretary of State tomorrow morning.
808456602076545025 The final Wisconsin vote is in and guess what - we just picked up an additional 131 votes. The Dems and Green Party can now rest. Scam!
808437742904418304 Tue: West Allis, WI.
808301935728230404 The F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th.
808300706914594816 Unless you catch hackers in the act, it is very hard to determine who was doing the hacking. Why wasn't this brought up before election?
808299841147248640 Can you imagine if the election results were the opposite and WE tried to play the Russia/CIA card. It would be called conspiracy theory!
808114703922843649 Just watched @NBCNightlyNews - So biased, inaccurate and bad, point after point. Just can't get much worse, although @CNN is right up there!
808107215492091904 Will be interviewed on @FoxNews at 10:00 P.M. Enjoy!
807970490635743237 Whether I choose him or not for State- Rex Tillerson, the Chairman & CEO of ExxonMobil, is a world class player and dealmaker. Stay tuned!

807589280071684096 A very interesting read. Unfortunately, so much is true.
807588632877998081 Reports by @CNN that I will be working on The Apprentice during my Presidency, even part time, are ridiculous & untrue - FAKE NEWS!
807565127021109252 As a show of support for our Armed Forces, I will be going to The Army-Navy Game today. Looking forward to it, should be fun!
807547249681166336 I have NOTHING to do with The Apprentice except for fact that I conceived it with Mark B & have a big stake in it. Will devote ZERO TIME!

781788223055994880 Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate?
781785509639118848 Using Alicia M in the debate as a paragon of virtue just shows that Crooked Hillary suffers from BAD JUDGEMENT! Hillary was set up by a con.
781784161044553728 Wow, Crooked Hillary was duped and used by my worst Miss U. Hillary floated her as an angel without checking her past, which is terrible!

777913567676866560 Hillary Clinton's weakness while she was Secretary of State, has emboldened terrorists all over the world.:
777910435425226753 Once again someone we were told is ok turns out to be a terrorist who wants to destroy our country & its people- how did he get thru system?
777908242538196992 Great job once again by law enforcement! We are proud of them and should embrace them - without them, we don't have a country!

777696726933180416 Terrible attacks in NY, NJ and MN this weekend. Thinking of victims, their families and all Americans! We need to be strong!
777696356211326976 Under the leadership of Obama & Clinton, Americans have experienced more attacks at home than victories abroad. Time to change the playbook!
777616135856545792 HAPPY BIRTHDAY - to the United States Air Force!!
777494113834917888 I would like to express my warmest regards, best wishes and condolences to all of the families and victims of the horrible bombing in NYC.
777284744253812740 Never met but never liked dopey Robert Gates. Look at the mess the U.S. is in. Always speaks badly of his many bosses, including Obama.
777281927841587200 Heading to Colorado for a big rally. Massive crowd, great people! Will be there soon - the polls are looking good.
777280259875975169 My lawyers want to sue the failing @nytimes so badly for irresponsible intent. I said no (for now), but they are watching. Really disgusting
777260548991819776 The failing @nytimes has gone nuts that Crooked Hillary is doing so badly. They are willing to say anything, has become a laughingstock rag!
777197786039103488 Crazy Maureen Dowd, the wacky columnist for the failing @nytimes, pretends she knows me well--wrong!
777197604887113728 Wacky @NYTimesDowd, who hardly knows me, makes up things that I never said for her boring interviews and column. A neurotic dope!
777133433915002880 @CNN just doesn't get it, and that's why their ratings are so low - and getting worse. Boring anti-Trump panelists, mostly losers in life!
777112789672341504 I never met former Defense Secretary Robert Gates. He knows nothing about me. But look at the results under his guidance - a total disaster!
777022559367770112 Crooked Hillary wants to take your 2nd Amendment rights away. Will guns be taken from her heavily armed Secret Service detail? Maybe not!
777015676586172417 My thoughts and prayers go out to the @PhillyPolice & @Penn police officers- in Philadelphia.
777013142526185473 Donald Trump's birther event is the greatest trick he's ever pulled

775275158340853760 I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 7:00 A.M.
774778026479513600 The seriously failing @nytimes, despite so much winning and poll numbers that will soon put me in first place, only writes dishonest hits!
774753598970466304 Hillary Clinton just had her 47% moment. What a terrible thing she said about so many great Americans!
774673449885192192 While Hillary said horrible things about my supporters, and while many of her supporters will never vote for me, I still respect them all!
774637168769830912 Really sad that Republicans would allow themselves to be used in a Clinton ad. Lindsey Graham, Romney, Flake, Sass. SUPREME COURT, REMEMBER!
774590070355529728 Wow, Hillary Clinton was SO INSULTING to my supporters, millions of amazing, hard working people. I think it will cost her at the Polls!

774354404162039808 MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
774299479155544064 Henry McMaster, Lt. Governor of South Carolina who endorsed me, beat failed @CNN announcer Bakari Sellers, so badly. Funny!
774256782290128896 Jeff Zucker failed @NBC and he is now failing @CNN.
774255510191239170 @CNN is unwatchable. Their news on me is fiction. They are a disgrace to the broadcasting industry and an arm of the Clinton campaign.
774097705513517057 The documentary of me that @CNN just aired is a total waste of time. I don't even know many of the people who spoke about me. A joke!
774064919633428480 Final poll results from NBC on last nights Commander-in-Chief Forum. Thank you! #ImWithYou #MAGA
774044548293074944 It wasn't Matt Lauer that hurt Hillary last night. It was her very dumb answer about emails & the veteran who said she should be in jail.
774033670239760384 More poll results from last nights Commander-in-Chief Forum.
773972305642913792 Last nights results - in poll taken by NBC. #AmericaFirst #ImWithYou
773948271140016128 With Luis, Mexico and the United States would have made wonderful deals together - where both Mexico and the US would have benefitted.
773948120069615616 Mexico has lost a brilliant finance minister and wonderful man who I know is highly respected by President PeÃÂ±a Nieto.
773920230192054272 Hillary Clinton answered email questions differently last night than she has in the past. She is totally confused. Unfit to serve as #POTUS.
773903163296473088 Hillary just gave a disastrous news conference on the tarmac to make up for poor performance last night. She's being decimated by the media!
773855962528620548 A rough night for Hillary Clinton ABC News.
773836389943246848 Wow, reviews are in - THANK YOU!

773181751749402624 Mainstream media never covered Hillary's massive hacking or coughing attack, yet it is #1 trending. What's up?
773140702972801024 As a tribute to the late, great Phyllis Schlafly, I hope everybody can go out and get her latest book, THE CONSERVATIVE CASE FOR TRUMP.
773116580733587456 China wouldn't provide a red carpet stairway from Air Force One and then Philippines President calls Obama the son of a whore. Terrible!
773113752271060992 The truly great Phyllis Schlafly, who honored me with her strong endorsement for president, has passed away at 92. She was very special!
772928797419143168 Thank you Ohio! #AmericaFirst

772797202922082304 Can you believe that the Chinese would not give Obama the proper stairway to get off his plane - fight on tarmac!
772793658072559616 President Obama & Putin fail to reach deal on Syria - so what else is new? Obama is not a natural deal maker. Only makes bad deals!
772582467601588224 Lyin' Hillary Clinton told the FBI that she did not know the C markings on documents stood for CLASSIFIED. How can this be happening?
772576650718482432 To the African-American community: The Democrats have failed you for fifty years, high crime, poor schools, no jobs. I will fix it, VOTE T
772574369633763329 The polls are close so Crooked Hillary is getting out of bed and will campaign tomorrow.Why did she hammer 13 devices and acid-wash e-mails?
772571293438840832 The Great State of Arizona, where I just had a massive rally (amazing people), has a very weak and ineffective Senator, Jeff Flake. Sad!
772556213313765377 The Republican Party needs strong and committed leaders, not weak people such as @JeffFlake, if it is going to stop illegal immigration.
772465330740404225 Crooked Hillary's V.P. pick said this morning that I was not aware that Russia took over Crimea. A total lie - and taken over during O term!
772417922279043073 Wow, the failing @nytimes has not reported properly on Crooked's FBI release. They are at the back of the pack - no longer a credible source
772171469476552704 @CNN is so disgusting in their bias, but they are having a hard time promoting Crooked Hillary in light of the new e-mail scandals.
772170704687099904 Great visit to Detroit church, fantastic reception, and all @CNN talks about is a small protest outside. Inside a large and wonderful crowd!
772166085974130697 I am returning to the Pensacola Bay Center in Florida- Friday, 9/9/16 at 7pm. Join me!
772123965938597888 Thank you Great Faith Ministries International, Bishop Wayne T. Jackson, and Detroit!

771686352438042624 Just heard that crazy and very dumb @morningmika had a mental breakdown while talking about me on the low ratings @Morning_Joe. Joe a mess!

771212706275741696 Hillary Clinton doesn't have the strength or the stamina to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! #AmericaFirst

771146302134423552 Great trip to Mexico today - wonderful leadership and high quality people! Look forward to our next meeting.
771145576381427712 Hillary Clinton didn't go to Louisiana, and now she didn't go to Mexico. She doesn't have the drive or stamina to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
770971306766381056 Former President Vicente Fox, who is railing against my visit to Mexico today, also invited me when he apologized for using the f bomb.
770832664303587328 Thank you Washington! Together, WE will MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN! #ImWithYou #AmericaFirst
770811688966770689 I have accepted the invitation of President Enrique Pena Nieto, of Mexico, and look very much forward to meeting him tomorrow.

770253550639251456 Now that African-Americans are seeing what a bad job Hillary type policy and management has done to the inner-cities, they want TRUMP!
770252177512230912 Crooked Hillary's brainpower is highly overrated.Probably why her decision making is so bad or, as stated by Bernie S, she has BAD JUDGEMENT
770250409843777536 Does anyone know that Crooked Hillary, who tried so hard, was unable to pass the Bar Exams in Washington D.C. She was forced to go elsewhere
770247094439469058 Inner-city crime is reaching record levels. African-Americans will vote for Trump because they know I will stop the slaughter going on!
770245313345052673 Look how bad it is getting! How much more crime, how many more shootings, will it take for African-Americans and Latinos to vote Trump=SAFE!
770040258796855296 I will be making a major speech on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION on Wednesday in the GREAT State of Arizona. Big crowds, looking for a larger venue.
770039317142069248 I think that both candidates, Crooked Hillary and myself, should release detailed medical records. I have no problem in doing so! Hillary?
770021252002119680 Today is the 53rd anniversary of the March on Washington - today we honor the enduring fight for justice, equality and opportunity.

769592508879892480 My condolences to Dwyane Wade and his family, on the loss of Nykea Aldridge. They are in my thoughts and prayers.
769571710924263424 Dwyane Wade's cousin was just shot and killed walking her baby in Chicago. Just what I have been saying. African-Americans will VOTE TRUMP!
769539271678013440 Heroin overdoses are taking over our children and others in the MIDWEST. Coming in from our southern border. We need strong border & WALL!

769253422549786628 Meet the Ã¢Trumpocrats': Lifelong Democrats Breaking w/ Party Over Hillary to Support Donald Trump for President:
769252637350866946 Hillary Clinton Deleted Emails Using Program Intended To Prevent Recovery #CrookedHillary
769221405820923905 How quickly people forget that Crooked Hillary called African-American youth SUPER PREDATORS - Has she apologized?
769203012250112006 I am very proud to have brought the subject of illegal immigration back into the discussion. Such a big problem for our country-I will solve
769185155198124032 Wonderful @pastormarkburns was attacked viciously and unfairly on @MSNBC by crazy @morningmika on low ratings @Morning_Joe. Apologize!
769177810678067200 What do African-Americans and Hispanics have to lose by going with me. Look at the poverty, crime and educational statistics. I will fix it!
769170204941164544 Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to solve the problems of poverty, education and safety within the African-American & Hispanic communities
769143845892136960 The Clinton's are the real predators...
769006162926669824 Hillary Clinton needs to address the racist undertones of her 2008 campaign. #FlashbackFriday
769002724218118144 CLINTON CORRUPTION AND HER SABOTAGE OF THE INNER CITIES.
769001435484688384 Hillary Clinton only knows how to make a speech when it is a hit on me. No policy, and always very short (stamina). Media gives her a pass!
768922208987127808 HRC is using the oldest play in the Dem playbook- when their policies fail, they are left w/this one tired argument!
768912241349517312 Hillary Clinton is using race-baiting to try to get African-American voters- but they know she is all talk and NO ACTION!
768904362211086336 Hillary Clinton's short speech is pandering to the worst instincts in our society. She should be ashamed of herself!
768903697166368769 Just watched recap of #CrookedHillary's speech. Very short and lies. She is the only one fear-mongering!
768791265811062788 So many in the African-American community are doing so badly, poverty and crime way up, employment and jobs way down: I will fix it, promise
768788761635356672 Poll numbers are starting to look very good. Leading in Florida @CNN Arizona and big jump in Utah. All numbers rising, national way up. Wow!
768624405777944576 Thoughts and prayers to the great people of Indiana. You will prevail!
768623966713999360 Great Governor @Mike_Pence is in Indiana to help lead the relief efforts after tornadoes struck. True leadership.

768119463421943808 President Obama should have gone to Louisiana days ago, instead of golfing. Too little, too late!
768097204376510464 Hillary Clinton strongly stated that there was absolutely no connection between her private work and that of The State Department. LIE!
768083669550366720 It is being reported by virtually everyone, and is a fact, that the media pile on against me is the worst in American political history!
768069472464666624 I am now in Texas doing a big fundraiser for the Republican Party and a @FoxNews Special on the BORDER and with victims of border crime!
767889674530594816 The @WashingtonPost quickly put together a hit job book on me- comprised of copies of some of their inaccurate stories. Don't buy, boring!
767888297125355521 @AnnCoulter's new book, 'In Trump We Trust, comes out tomorrow. People are saying it's terrific - knowing Ann I am sure it is!
767870642716831744 Just leaving Akron, Ohio, after a packed rally. Amazing people! Going now to Texas.
767830376735735808 Great meeting with active & retired law enforcement officers- at the Fraternal Order of Police lodge in Akron, Ohio.

767685048703279104 Some day, when things calm down, I'll tell the real story of @JoeNBC and his very insecure long-time girlfriend, @morningmika. Two clowns!
767683204039974912 Tried watching low-rated @Morning_Joe this morning, unwatchable! @morningmika is off the wall, a neurotic and not very bright mess!
767528750749810688 I heard that @Morning_Joe was very nice on Friday but that little Donny D, a big failure in TV (& someone I helped), was nasty. Irrelevant!
767520065608613888 Crooked Hillary is flooding the airwaves with false and misleading ads - all paid for by her bosses on Wall Street. Media is protecting her!
767505383430782976 I have been drawing very big and enthusiastic crowds, but the media refuses to show or discuss them. Something very big is happening!
767150340726779904 Together, we are going to MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN!
767137098679853056 We will bring America together as ONE country again Ã¢ united as Americans in common purpose and common dreams. #MAGA

766627569110249472 Thank you to everyone for all of the nice comments, by Twitter, pundits and otherwise for my speech last night.
766616610975182848 The reporting at the failing @nytimes gets worse and worse by the day. Fortunately, it is a dying newspaper.
766616361720246272 Thank you to NC for last evenings great reception. The speech was a great success. Heading now to Louisiana & another speech tonight in MI.
766585563805802497 We are one nation. When one state hurts, we all hurt. We must all work together - to lift each other up.

766002945485864961 We will repeal & replace #Obamacare, which has caused soaring double-digit premium increases. It is a disaster!
765955844055760896 A vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for another generation of poverty, high crime, & lost opportunities. #ImWithYou
765950471160954884 Thank you Governor @ScottWalker & @GOP Chairman @Reince Priebus.
765902170084483073 Join me in North Carolina - tomorrow at 7:30pm! #ImWithYou
765726909925851136 Will be on @SeanHannity tonight at 10pmE - delivering an important speech live from Wisconsin. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
765688915932045313 Just as we won the Cold War, in part, by exposing the evils of communism and the virtues of free markets....
765679267086684161 This is my pledge to the American people:
765629939811020802 'It's just a 2-point race, Clinton 38%, Trump 36%'
765623972234948608 Another health insurer is pulling back due to 'persistent financial losses on #Obamacare plans.' Only the beginning!
765283490887790592 CLINTON REFUGEE PLAN COULD BRING IN 620,000 REFUGEES IN FIRST TERM AT LIFETIME COST OF OVER $400 BILLION.
764998650598686721 Certain Republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the U.S.Supreme Court get proper appointments. Sad!
764976828914237440 Stay on message is the chant. I always do - trade, jobs, military, vets, 2nd A, repeal Ocare, borders, etc - but media misrepresents!
764974286931169285 I have always been the same person-remain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so!
764870785634799617 It is not freedom of the press when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!
764867963845484545 I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it!
764866887511572480 Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media. She is not a talented person or politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose!
764805340823248896 My rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm.
764803159692836864 If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words I say, I would be beating Hillary by 20%
764801590415024128 The failing @nytimes, which never spoke to me, keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change. False, I am who I am-never said
764799933325144064 The failing @nytimes talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened. Their reporting is fiction. The media protects Hillary!
764552764177481728 We now have confirmation as to one reason Crooked H wanted to be sure that nobody saw her e-mails - PAY-FOR-PLAY. How can she run for Pres.
764531827168186369 I am truly enjoying myself while running for president. The people of our country are amazing - great numbers on November 8th!
764529295901528064 The failing @nytimes has become a newspaper of fiction. Their stories about me always quote non-existent unnamed sources. Very dishonest!
764254551822196737 Will be on @seanhannity tonight at 10pm, hosted by @GovMikeHuckabee. Enjoy!
764186768522420224 Thank you Erie, Pennsylvania! Together we will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!
764153606765412352 Unbelievable support in Florida last night - thank you! #MAGA
764148063724183552 We need your support to get to the White House and defeat #CrookedHillary. Let's Make America Great Again!
764147780583436292 The Establishment and special interests are absolutely killing our country. We must put #AmericaFirst.
764147591114137600 I'm with YOU. I will work hard and never let you down. Make America Great Again!
764132571638738944 I'm with YOU! I will work hard and never let you down. Make America Great Again!
764131726071214081 The Establishment and special interests are absolutely killing our country. We must put #AmericaFirst.
764084294704697344 ISIS gained tremendous strength during Hillary Clinton's term as Secretary of State. When will the dishonest media report the facts!
764064821000056832 I love watching these poor, pathetic people (pundits) on television working so hard and so seriously to try and figure me out. They can't!
764055793951834114 A massive tax increase will be necessary to fund Crooked Hillary Clinton's agenda. What a terrible (and boring) rollout that was yesterday!
764045345332396032 Ratings challenged @CNN reports so seriously that I call President Obama (and Clinton) the founder of ISIS, & MVP. THEY DON'T GET SARCASM?
763967302433853440 I'm with YOU. I will work hard and never let you down. Make America Great Again!
763860288533856256 I am counting on your help to defeat Hillary Clinton and her cronies. Let's Make America Great Again!
763857902490836992 Will be doing @oreillyfactor tonight at 8pm. Enjoy!
763740672012738561 This is no surprise. Constant phony reporting from failing @CNN turns everyone off. The American people get it!
763558559833591809 Thank you Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
763557327295438848 Great job today by the NYPD in protecting the people and saving the climber.
763519861406531584 Reuters just announced that Secret Service never spoke to me or my campaign. Made up story by @CNN is a hoax. Totally dishonest.
763481802254249984 Thank you Abingdon, Virginia!
763477408909500416 No such meeting or conversation ever happened - a made up story by low ratings @CNN.
763474491183816704 Great meeting w/ coal miners & leaders from the Virginia coal industry- thank you! #MAGA
763433452893011969 I will be interviewed on @greta tonight at 7pm. Enjoy!
763430568721784833 My thoughts and prayers are with the two police officers shot in Sebastian County, Arkansas. #LESM
763398630812311552 Morning Joe's weakness is its low ratings. I don't watch anymore but I heard he went wild against Rudy Giuliani and #2A - sad & irrelevant!
763391459110313984 @dbongino You were fantastic in defending both the Second Amendment and me last night on @CNN. Don Lemon is a lightweight - dumb as a rock
763198483927011329 Media desperate to distract from Clinton's anti-2A stance. I said pro-2A citizens must organize and get out vote to save our Constitution!
763180978588221440 When is the media going to talk about Hillary's policies that have gotten people killed, like Libya, open borders, and maybe her emails?
763167671974232064 Thank you Senator @ChuckGrassley! #TrumpPence16

762842126900015105 Being in Detroit today was wonderful. Quick stop in Ohio to meet with some of our great supporters. Just got back home!

762439658911338496 #ICYMI: Will Media Apologize to Trump?
762425371874557952 Michael Morell, the lightweight former Acting Director of C.I.A., and a man who has made serious bad calls, is a total Clinton flunky!
762400869858115588 The media is going crazy. They totally distort so many things on purpose. Crimea, nuclear, the baby and so much more. Very dishonest!
762284533341417472 I see where Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake of Baltimore is pushing Crooked hard. Look at the job she has done in Baltimore. She is a joke!
762110918721310721 Thank you Windham, New Hampshire! #TrumpPence16 #MAGA
762106904436961280 @Larry_Kudlow - 'Donald Trump Is the middle-class growth candidate'

761931010548305920 Crooked Hillary said loudly, and for the world to see, that she SHORT CIRCUITED when answering a question on her e-mails. Very dangerous!
761892829434183684 Hillary Clinton is being badly criticized for her poor performance in answering questions. Let us all see what happens!
761757988516401153 'Trump is right about violent crime: It's on the rise in major cities'

761549461893984256 Hillary Clinton has bad judgment and is unfit to serve as President.
761511930238496772 The plane I saw on television was the hostage plane in Geneva, Switzerland, not the plane carrying $400 million in cash going to Iran!
761386080272875520 President Obama refuses to answer question about Iran terror funding. I won't dodge questions as your President.
761386025323225088 Obama's disastrous judgment gave us ISIS, rise of Iran, and the worst economic numbers since the Great Depression!
761385812390977536 President Obama should ask the DNC about how they rigged the election against Bernie.
761385317169496064 See you tomorrow w/ Gov. @Mike_Pence, Iowa & Wisconsin!

760957697579708416 THANK YOU Daytona Beach, Florida!
760783130978648064 Our incompetent Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, was the one who started talks to give 400 million dollars, in cash, to Iran. Scandal!
760765818917515264 There is great unity in my campaign, perhaps greater than ever before. I want to thank everyone for your tremendous support. Beat Crooked H!
760669268539301889 Great day in Virginia. Crowd was fantastic!

760420894271471620 The Washington Post calls out #CrookedHillary for what she REALLY is. A PATHOLOGICAL LIAR! Watch that nose grow!
760299757206208512 Great afternoon in Ohio & a great evening in Pennsylvania - departing now. See you tomorrow Virginia!
760293742381244416 Just leaving Mechanicsburg, PA. Incredible crowd-- so enthusiastic! Will be back soon. #MAGA
760287440435187712 Vast numbers of manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania have moved to Mexico and other countries. That will end when I win!
760255085561597952 Thanks to @pnehlen for your kind words, very much appreciated.
760249495754006528 Join me in Florida on Wednesday! Daytona & Jacksonville:
760247348673077248 During the GOP convention, CNN cut away from the victims of illegal immigrant violence. They don't want them heard.
760246898095775744 When will CNN do a segment on Hillary's plan to increase Syrian refugees 550% and how much it will cost?
760246732152311808 Hillary Clinton raked in money from regimes that horribly oppress women and gays & refuses to speak out against Radical Islam.
760245342231158785 Hillary, whose decisions have led to the deaths of many, accepted $ from a business linked to ISIS. Silence at CNN.
760229355784138752 Crooked Hillary Clinton is 100% owned by her donors. #ImWithYou #MAGA
760214225830772737 Thank you Columbus, Ohio! I will be back soon. #ImWithYou #MAGA
760213628926779392 Thank you Oklahoma & Virginia!
760185303483187201 People believe CNN these days almost as little as they believe Hillary....that's really saying something!
760185067054465024 The people who support Hillary sit behind CNN anchor chairs, or headline fundraisers - those disconnected from real life.
760184664468418560 Will CNN send its cameras to the border to show the massive unreported crisis now unfolding -- or are they worried it will hurt Hillary?
760184336603811842 When will we see stories from CNN on Clinton Foundation corruption and Hillary's pay-for-play at State Department?
760184176591208448 CNN anchors are completely out of touch with everyday people worried about rising crime, failing schools and vanishing jobs.
760184028293173248 CNN will soon be the least trusted name in news if they continue to be the press shop for Hillary Clinton.
760126146830794753 Join Governor Mike Pence in Reno, Nevada- tonight at 7pm! Tickets available at:
760098514319835136 So with all of the Obama tough talk on Russia and the Ukraine, they have already taken Crimea and continue to push. That's what I said!
760095370185674752 When I said in an interview that Putin is not going into Ukraine, you can mark it down, I am saying if I am President. Already in Crimea!
760074526059270144 This story is not about Mr. Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart!
760070280932982784 Mr. Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same - Nice!
759915863600304128 Wow, it is unbelievable how distorted, one-sided and biased the media is against us. The failing @nytimes is a joke. @CNN is laughable!
759843323909668865 The dishonest media is fawning over the Democratic Convention. I wonder why, then, my speech had millions of more viewers than Crooked H?
759743648573435905 I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq war, not me!
759734698415312897 Captain Khan, killed 12 years ago, was a hero, but this is about RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR and the weakness of our leaders to eradicate it!
759622329680990208 We crushed the original goal! I will write a $2 MILLION check to our campaign if we hit our end-of-month goal!
759592590106849280 Nielson Media Research final numbers on ACCEPTANCE SPEECH: TRUMP 32.2 MILLION. CLINTON 27.8 MILLION. Thank you!
759524001613918208 Thank you to all of the television viewers that made my speech at the Republican National Convention #1 over Crooked Hillary and DEMS.
759516008272932864 Can you imagine if I had the small crowds that Hillary is drawing today in Pennsylvania. It would be a major media event! @CNN @FoxNews
759515080010719232 NATO commander agrees members should pay up via @dcexaminer:
759513644258525184 Wow, NATO's top commander just announced that he agrees with me that alliance members must PAY THEIR BILLS. This is a general I will like!
759512042906587137 The Rust Belt was created by politicians like the Clintons who allowed our jobs to be stolen from us by other countries like Mexico. END!
759509936002957314 Crooked's stop in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, where jobs have been absolutely decimated by dumb politicians, drew less than 200 - with Bill, VP
759507812963737600 #CrookedHillary = Obama's third term, which would be terrible news for our economic growth - seen below.
759506712516784128 Word is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania. Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA?
759479059046883328 I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch. Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better!
759477522232901632 Why doesn't the media want to report that on the two Big Thursdays when Crooked Hillary and I made our speeches - Republican's won ratings
759450265208651776 Crooked Hillary Clinton is soft on crime, supports open borders, and wants massive tax hikes. A formula for disaster!
759450053379579905 Violent crime is rising across the United States, yet the DNC convention ignored it. Crime reduction will be one of my top priorities.
759444833698062336 I will write a $2 MILLION check to our campaign if we hit our million-dollar end-of-month goal!
759425642723246084 Just got back from Colorado. The love and enthusiasm at two rallies was incredible. Big crowds!
759393092554424320 While I am in OH & PA - you can also join @Mike_Pence in Nevada on Mon!
759389559385952257 Join me Monday in Columbus, Ohio & Harrisburg, Pennsylvania! #MAGA
759381869267980288 American homeownership rate in Q2 2016 was 62.9% - lowest rate in 51yrs. WE will bring back the 'American Dream!'
759372422692954112 We are suffering through the worst long-term unemployment in the last 70 years. I want change - Crooked Hillary Clinton does not.
759371648764108801 Hillary can never win over Bernie supporters. Her foreign wars, NAFTA/TPP support & Wall Street ties are driving away millions of votes.
759371377002553344 Colorado was amazing yesterday! So much support. Our tax, trade and energy reforms will bring great jobs to Colorado and the whole country.
759227755494072320 Thank you Denver, Colorado!
759222916387069952 As usual, Hillary & the Dems are trying to rig the debates so 2 are up against major NFL games. Same as last time w/ Bernie. Unacceptable!
759191265988653056 Hillary Clinton should not be given national security briefings in that she is a lose cannon with extraordinarily bad judgement & insticts.
759185456818860032 Thank you to the amazing law enforcement officers in Colorado!
759152897602916352 Thank you Colorado Springs. Get out & VOTE #TrumpPence16 in November!
759117301517996032 Only a Reagan or a Trump-like figure in the White House will achieve this goal.
759093740497764353 Even Bill is tired of the lies, SAD!
759088844683608064 Join me in Colorado Springs at 2pm- or in Denver tonight at 7pm!
759084522705068032 What Bernie Sanders really thinks of Crooked Hillary Clinton.
759082026687352834 I am watching Crooked Hillary speak. Same old stuff, our country needs change!
759071976182861824 Wow, my campaign is hearing from more and more Bernie supporters that they will NEVER support Crooked Hillary. She sold them out, V.P. pick!
759070976181084160 In Hillary Clinton's America - things get worse. #TrumpPence16
759070106546638849 The dishonest media didn't mention that Bernie Sanders was very angry looking during Crooked's speech. He wishes he didn't make that deal!
759029315006705664 Crooked Hillary said that I couldn't handle the rough and tumble of a political campaign. Really,I just beat 16 people and am beating her!
759027356434518016 If Michael Bloomberg ran again for Mayor of New York, he wouldn't get 10% of the vote - they would run him out of town! #NeverHillary
759025610249216000 Little Michael Bloomberg, who never had the guts to run for president, knows nothing about me. His last term as Mayor was a disaster!
759024055123009536 General John Allen, who I never met but spoke against me last night, failed badly in his fight against ISIS. His record = BAD #NeverHillary
759021886055387136 Crooked Hillary Clinton mentioned me 22 times in her very long and very boring speech. Many of her statements were lies and fabrications!
759017481633542145 Join @mike_pence at the University of Northwestern Ohio- tonight at 7pm. Tickets:
759013889761697794 Two policemen just shot in San Diego, one dead. It is only getting worse. People want LAW AND ORDER!
759008377577967616 Crooked Hillary Clinton made up facts about me, and forgot to mention the many problems of our country, in her very average scream!
759005597899436032 The media coverage this morning of the very average Clinton speech and Convention is a joke. @CNN and the little watched @Morning_Joe = SAD!
758874457142284288 No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton - corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes.
758873961425805312 Hillary's wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction, terrorism and ISIS across the world.
758873275044798464 Hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety.
758872873234681860 Hillary will never reform Wall Street. She is owned by Wall Street!
758872422028148740 Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words.
758871653547806724 Hillary's refusal to mention Radical Islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country.
758864221140455425 I will once again write a $1 MILLION check to our campaign if we hit our million-dollar end-of-month goal!
758851150175055874 Departing now - thank you Cedar Rapids, Iowa. This is a MOVEMENT!
758845607578435584 I will once again write a $1 MILLION check to our campaign if we hit our million-dollar end-of-month goal!
758783228622671872 As President, I WILL fix this rigged system and only answer to YOU, the American people!
758778607489708032 Dems warn not to underestimate Trump's potential win
758771144140820481 Great to be back in Iowa! #TBT with @JerryJrFalwell joining me in Davenport- this past winter. #MAGA
758768028595032064 Median household income is down for the middle class since Obama took office. It will only go further down under Clinton.
758761945910669312 A vote for Clinton-Kaine is a vote for TPP, NAFTA, high taxes, radical regulation, and massive influx of refugees.
758680707979943937 President Obama spoke last night about a world that doesn't exist. 70% of the people think our country is going in the wrong direction. #DNC
758492727583576064 Our country does not feel 'great already' to the millions of wonderful people living in poverty, violence and despair.
758491947409481728 Shooting deaths of police officers up 78% this year. We must restore law and order and protect our great law enforcement officers!
758452289376022529 Join me live in Toledo, Ohio!
758406953081065472 As President, I will bring jobs back and get wages up for Americans who need it most.
758380358874247168 Thank you to our amazing law enforcement officers! #MAGA
758367154232320000 Trump right: Illegal families crossing border set to double, 51,152 so far
758350470402408449 Great new poll - thank you!
758335147183788032 If Russia or any other country or person has Hillary Clinton's 33,000 illegally deleted emails, perhaps they should share them with the FBI!
758331893809090560 Join our next Vice President, @Mike_Pence in Wisconsin tonight & Michigan Thursday!
758286077400580096 Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining-then a small one. Pathetic
758285141982711808 Our not very bright Vice President, Joe Biden, just stated that I wanted to carpet bomb the enemy. Sorry Joe, that was Ted Cruz!
758242674646323200 Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO!
758240929564258305 Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough!
758238226180083712 The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD!
758236300554174465 Funny how the failing @nytimes is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said Trump is a genius. America 1st!
758233935230959617 As I have been saying, Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election, despite her statements to the contrary: top adv.
758135085820416000 Just like I have warned from the beginning, Crooked Hillary Clinton will betray you on the TPP.
758122684798607360 Many of Bernie's supporters have left the arena. Did Bernie go home and go to sleep?
758121939365982208 I hate to say it, but the Republican Convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the Democratic Convention!
758120321845235712 No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. Highly overrated!
758117640200187905 You have no idea what my strategy on ISIS is, and neither does ISIS (a good thing). Please get your facts straight - thanks. @megynkelly
758085148164272128 I'm with you! I will work hard and never let you down. Make America Great Again!
758084767174631425 I'm with you! I will work hard and never let you down. Make America Great Again!
758083054019588096 I'm with you! I will work hard and never let you down. Make America Great Again!
758071952498159616 For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia.
758071264128806912 In order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster, the Dems said maybe it is Russia dealing with Trump. Crazy!
758026136299397120 Dems don't want to talk ISIS b/c Hillary's foreign interventions unleashed ISIS & her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here.
758021060503756804 Bernie's exhausted, he just wants to shut down and go home to bed!
758020997383684096 The invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for Crooked Hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar!
758004154417553409 Thank you New Hampshire!
757997327269306369 Join us in Toledo, Ohio- tomorrow night at 8pm! #TrumpPence16 #MAGA
757994830110658560 Join us tomorrow in Scranton, Pennsylvania at 3pm!
757919034755076096 Pocahontas bombed last night! Sad to watch.
757918002339778560 Why aren't the Democrats speaking about ISIS, bad trade deals, broken borders, police and law and order. The Republican Convention was great
757916962269704192 Funny, if you listen to @FoxNews, the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two, they are fawning. What a difference
757777369272815617 Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! Waste of time.
757775689525309440 Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated!
757773671545044992 Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.
757760973419712512 If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself.
757696233427312640 I was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing. He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air!
757693383481626624 Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time, energy and money. The V.P. a joke!
757690343181737984 While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers.
757690132111777792 Clinton betrayed Bernie voters. Kaine supports TPP, is in pocket of Wall Street, and backed Iraq War.
757688331597668353 Thank you OHIO! #TrumpPence16
757687988189065216 Thank you Roanoke, Virginia- be back soon! #TrumpPence16
757650904896139264 MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN! #TrumpPence16
757577508346888192 Great POLL numbers are coming out all over. People don't want another four years of Obama, and Crooked Hillary would be even worse. #MAGA
757576490213146624 The State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE!
757573051215147008 Wow, the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn!
757571837463240704 Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance!
757565892146454532 Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her servant was doing at the DNC - they just got caught, that's all! They laughed at Bernie.
757552876348645377 If Bernie Sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same.
757546442240167936 Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!
757545252026712064 How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against Bernie!
757538729170964481 The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me
757364534873128960 Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS & all others laughing!
757361504895246336 The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you!
757343025983057922 The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she's out!
757338816487235584 The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive & well!
757336511436075008 Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!
757335224397225984 Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out
757332905047752704 If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wild
757315800466272256 The @CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN!
757311921095925760 I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left!
757309616254545920 Today proves what I have always known, that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.)
757206444148158464 Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!
757205678821928960 There is no longer a Bernie Sanders political revolution. He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end!
757191160481873920 An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.
757187537681154048 Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!
757182723089895424 Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!
757174767547977728 Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT
757172536882913280 The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H!
756973646216884225 Thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on Thursday night. From the heart!
756962332228612096 The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her, unless he is a fraud!
756952917152784384 Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don't look presidential to me!
756883131685273605 I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs!
756875689924694016 Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer!
756866912848584704 Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back!
756864330054893568 Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA.
756804886038192128 Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED
756801575193042944 Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also, Crooked Hillary hates her!
756799923648102400 Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing!
756798838900396032 The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine, who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight?
756697615509688320 I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam.
756691116464959488 Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn't get indicted while Bob M did?
756625700539465728 Another attack, this time in Germany. Many killed. God bless the people of Munich.
756490485116575744 One of the best produced, including the incredible stage & set, in the history of conventions. Great unity! Big T.V. ratings! @KarlRove
756477153986895872 Thank you Cleveland. We love you and will be back many times!
756475847004057601 What a great four days in Cleveland. So proud of the great job done by the RNC and all. The police and Secret Service were fantastic!

755810077307727872 STATEMENT ON MELANIA SPEECH
755788382618390529 The media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of Melania's speech than the FBI spent on Hillary's emails.
755787159735570432 Good news is Melania's speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press!
755747074939949056 In November, I think the people of Ohio will remember that the Republicans picked Cleveland instead of going to another state. Jobs!
755746062204280833 Bill Hemmer of @FoxNews was very nice in explaining the excitement and energy in the arena. More than in past years.
755708398537154560 Congratulations to my children, Don and Tiffany, on having done a fantastic job last night. I am very proud of you!
755551039244341253 Such a great honor to be the Republican Nominee for President of the United States. I will work hard and never let you down! AMERICA FIRST!
755525857456844800 The ROLL CALL is beginning at the Republican National Convention. Very exciting!
755254384062263296 It was truly an honor to introduce my wife, Melania. Her speech and demeanor were absolutely incredible. Very proud! #GOPConvention
755195907658883072 Will be on @OreillyFactor tonight at 8:30pm @FoxNews- prior to Melania's speech at the #GOPConvention. Tune in- she will do great! #RNCinCLE
755143081666744320 Networks other than low ratings @CNN have been very fair and exciting!
755142098190475265 @CNN is the worst.They go to their dumb, one-sided panels when a podium speaker is for Trump! VAST MAJORITY want: Make America Great Again!
755091783013507072 Looking forward to being at the convention tonight to watch all of the wonderful speakers including my wife, Melania. Place looks beautiful!
755087399286411266 Thank you Mahoning County, Ohio! See you soon! #MakeAmericaSafeAgain
754789482621243392 President Obama just had a news conference, but he doesn't have a clue. Our country is a divided crime scene, and it will only get worse!
754788362368741376 Our country is totally divided and our enemies are watching. We are not looking good, we are not looking smart, we are not looking tough!
754747397700485120 I will be on @60Minutes tonight at 7:00 P.M. with Mike Pence talking about LAW AND ORDER and many other subjects! Bad times for divided USA!
754744188856565760 We are TRYING to fight ISIS, and now our own people are killing our police. Our country is divided and out of control. The world is watching
754730058913308673 We grieve for the officers killed in Baton Rouge today. How many law enforcement and people have to...
754664207799451648 The ratings at @FoxNews blow away the ratings of @CNN - not even close. That's because CNN is the Clinton News Network and people don't like
754662980164386816 @FoxNews is much better, and far more truthful, than @CNN, which is all negative. Guests are stacked for Crooked Hillary! I don't watch.
754652888752910336 If Goofy Elizabeth Warren, a very weak Senator, didn't lie about her heritage (being Native American) she would be nothing today. Pick her H
754650547932758016 I hope that Crooked Hillary picks Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, as her V.P. Then we can litigate her fraud!
754648419151511552 It doesn't matter that Crooked Hillary has experience, look at all of the bad decisions she has made. Bernie said she has bad judgement!
754645662357159936 As the days and weeks go by, we see what a total mess our country (and world) is in - Crooked Hillary Clinton led Obama into bad decisions!
754530838386208768 We are going to have a great time in Cleveland. Will lead to special results for our country. We will Make America Great Again!
754530019200884737 Goofy Elizabeth Warren, who may be the least productive Senator in the U.S. Senate, must prove she is not a fraud. Without the con it's over
754520788917780482 Thank you to Jack Morgan, Tamara Neo, Cheryl Ann Kraft and all of my friends and supporters in Virginia. GREAT JOB!
754514805264973824 Thank you to Chris Cox and Bikers for Trump - Your support has been amazing. I will never forget. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

754305404302139392 Crooked Hillary Clinton is bought and paid for by Wall Street, lobbyists and special interests. She will sell our country down the tubes!
754304371186405376 Very sad that a person who has made so many mistakes, Crooked Hillary Clinton, can put out such false and vicious ads with her phony money!
754303051389861888 Crooked Hillary, who embarrassed herself and the country with her e-mail lies, has been a DISASTER on foreign policy. Look what's happening!
754301737431928832 Crooked Hillary is spending big Wall Street money on ads saying I don't have foreign policy experience, yet look what her policies have done
754291925616852992 Look forward to introducing Governor Mike Pence (who has done a spectacular job in the great State of Indiana). My first choice from start!

753750790590828544 My prayers and condolences to the victims and families of the terrible tragedy in Nice, France. We are with you in every way!
753728269019549696 In light of the horrible attack in Nice, France, I have postponed tomorrow's news conference concerning my Vice Presidential announcement.
753720863606775809 Another horrific attack, this time in Nice, France. Many dead and injured. When will we learn? It is only getting worse.
753641197588152320 I employ many people in the State of Virginia - JOBS, JOBS, JOBS! Crooked Hillary will sell us out, just like her husband did with NAFTA.
753603401854881793 Another new poll. Thank you for your support! Join the MOVEMENT today!
753580257895211008 Great new poll- thank you America!
753398572515725312 I will be making the announcement of my Vice Presidential pick on Friday at 11am in Manhattan. Details to follow.
753355507721646080 If I win the Presidency, we will swamp Justice Ginsburg with real judges and real legal opinions!
753355262363181056 Even the @NYTimes and @WashingtonPost Editorial Boards condemned Justice Ginsburg for her ethical and legal breach. What was she thinking?
753354905897668608 Is Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg going to apologize to me for her misconduct? Big mistake by an incompetent judge!
753354233311731712 On my way to San Diego to raise money for the Republican Party. I am spending a lot myself and also helping others.
753353898472017920 Voters understand that Crooked Hillary's negative ads are not true- just like her email lies and her other fraudulent activity.
753353259411054592 Despite spending $500k a day on TV ads alone #CrookedHillary falls flat in nationwide @QuinnipiacPoll. Having ZERO impact. Sad!!
753351063407767554 Lyin' Crooked Hillary's email stories all have one thing in common.
753349911983235072 Is President Obama trying to destroy Israel with all his bad moves? Think about it and let me know!
753349629870084096 The Republican platform is most pro-Israel of all time!
753347448743964672 New GOP platform now includes language that supports the border wall. We will build the wall and MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!
753338900647665664 #CrookedHillary is outspending me by a combined 31 to 1 in Florida, Ohio, & Pennsylvania. I haven't started yet!

752973319675273218 The American people agree. No free pass for #CrookedHillary!
752911479251296258 To all the Bernie voters who want to stop bad trade deals & global special interests, we welcome you with open arms. People first.
752911332756840448 Bernie sanders has abandoned his supporters by endorsing pro-war pro-TPP pro-Wall Street Crooked Hillary Clinton.
752910855939952640 Bernie Sanders endorsing Crooked Hillary Clinton is like Occupy Wall Street endorsing Goldman Sachs.
752906803810279424 #CrookedHillary is not qualified!
752860045084241920 I am somewhat surprised that Bernie Sanders was not true to himself and his supporters. They are not happy that he is selling out!
752859250628648962 Bernie Sanders, who has lost most of his leverage, has totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. He will endorse her today - fans angry!
752849315094298624 This election is a choice between law, order & safety - or chaos, crime & violence. I will make America safe again for everyone. #ImWithYou
752848856317059073 For too many years, our inner cities have been left behind. I am going to deliver jobs, safety and protection for those in need.

752471941416620033 Join me in Westfield, Indiana- tomorrow night at 7:30pm! #Trump2016
752215352122208256 I heard that the underachieving John King of @CNN on Inside Politics was one hour of lies. Happily, few people are watching - dead network!
752211419634933760 The media is so dishonest. If I make a statement, they twist it and turn it to make it sound bad or foolish.They think the public is stupid!
752207752852832256 President Obama thinks the nation is not as divided as people think. He is living in a world of the make believe!
752110630031749120 Look what is happening to our country under the WEAK leadership of Obama and people like Crooked Hillary Clinton. We are a divided nation!
751889266934964224 New poll - thank you! #Trump2016
751797800690708480 Way to go @serenawilliams - you are a true champion. Proud of you!
751558217075945476 MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!
751529041988116485 Isn't it sad that on a day of national tragedy Hillary Clinton is answering softball questions about her email lies on @CNN?
751423658627829760 Due to the horrific events taking place in our country, I have decided to postpone my speech on economic opportunity- today in Miami.
751405672877744128 Last night's horrific execution-style shootings of 12 Dallas law enforcement officers...
751370918027489280 Prayers and condolences to all of the families who are so thoroughly devastated by the horrors we are all watching take place in our country
751232353129955328 After today, Crooked Hillary can officially be called Lyin' Crooked Hillary.
751146264956395521 Thank you Speaker @PRyan!
751145002147966976 Thank you Rep. Collins! #Trump2016
751115433273688064 Just leaving D.C. Had great meetings with Republicans in the House and Senate. Very interesting day! These are people who love our country!
751016366925344768 Great being in Cincinnati, Ohio last night- thank you! Off to Washington D.C. now. #Trump2016 #AmericaFirst
750865499660091393 Where is the outrage for this Disney book? Is this the 'Star of David' also?
750811268219543552 To all of my twitter followers, please contribute whatever you can to the campaign. We must beat Crooked Hillary.
750714064574218245 Convention speaker schedule to be released tomorrow. Let today be devoted to Crooked Hillary and the rigged system under which we live.
750692436687585280 I have over seven million hits on social media re Crooked Hillary Clinton. Check it out Sleepy Eyes, @MarkHalperin @NBCPolitics
750691056551878656 Sleepy eyes Chuck Todd, a man with so little touch for politics, is at it again.He could not have watched my standing ovation speech in N.C.
750681915565477888 Even the once great Caesars is bankrupt in A.C. Others to follow. Ask the Democrat City Council what happened to Atlantic City.
750678866532990977 Hillary Clinton should ask why the Democrat pols in Atlantic City made all the wrong moves - Convention Center, Airport - and destroyed City
750677864379453440 I made a lot of money in Atlantic City and left 7 years ago, great timing (as all know). Pols made big mistakes, now many bankruptcies.
750668480559607808 Crooked Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI and to the people of our country. She is sooooo guilty. But watch, her time will come!
750663349025767424 The rigged system may have helped Hillary Clinton escape criminal charges, but...
750650894040064000 Crooked Hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest, incompetent and of very bad judgement.
750648675186147328 Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information. Not fit!
750548959240843265 Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U.S. Her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. BAD JUDGEMENT!
750547338817638401 I don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with murder. Come November 8, she's out!
750545570293506048 Raised a lot of money for the Republican Party. There will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning. Lots of support! Win
750514941753434113 I will be interviewed by @oreillyfactor tonight on @FoxNews at 11pm. Enjoy!
750492628362334208 My son, @EricTrump will be interviewed by @SeanHannity tonight at 10pm on @FoxNews. Enjoy!
750397898861445120 Looking forward to meeting with @SenBobCorker in a little while. We will be traveling to North Carolina together today.
750353319084843008 FBI director said Crooked Hillary compromised our national security. No charges. Wow! #RiggedSystem
750352884106223616 The system is rigged. General Petraeus got in trouble for far less. Very very unfair! As usual, bad judgment.
750299631792291840 It was great spending time with @joniernst yesterday. She has done a fantastic job for the people of Iowa and U.S. Will see her again!
750286846534582272 Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary. A total disgrace!
750101826821877760 On @FoxNews at 7:00 P.M. Special: Meet the Trumps Hope you enjoy!
750094399456026624 Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays?
749989709275885568 With Hillary and Obama, the terrorist attacks will only get worse. Politically correct fools, won't even call it what it is - RADICAL ISLAM!
749987869452828672 Crooked Hillary Clinton is guilty as hell but the system is totally rigged and corrupt! Where are the 33,000 missing e-mails?
749972298086645760 The only people who are not interested in being the V.P. pick are the people who have not been asked!
749970824766091264 I look forward to meeting @joniernst today in New Jersey. She has done a great job as Senator of Iowa!
749968796618817538 Spent time with Indiana Governor Mike Pence and family yesterday. Very impressed, great people!
749965127278034944 Senator Tom Cotton was great on Meet the Press yesterday. Despite a totally one-sided interview by Chuck Todd, the end result was solid!
749961528422625281 Dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriff's Star, or plain star!
749959090210832386 Happy 4th of July! #Trump2016 #AmericaFirst
749935837748596736 Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to handle the complexities and danger of ISIS - it will just go on forever. We need change!
749934450868387840 The third mass attack (slaughter) in days by ISIS. 200 dead in Baghdad, worst in many years. We do not have leadership that can stop this!
749929565661884417 In Bangladesh, hostages were immediately killed by ISIS terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the Koran. 20 were killed!
749721116911034368 I believe that Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have the meeting with the U.S.A.G. So Bill is not in trouble with H except that he got caught!
749720224220475393 The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting go away, no pictures.
749718947973529600 Does anybody really believe that Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. talked only about grandkids and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac?
749709462974435329 THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!
749706242579247105 On Saturday a great man, Elie Wiesel, passed away.The world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil!
749699315367612416 Crooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the U.S.A.G. to work out a deal. The system is totally rigged & corrupt!
749698321074180096 Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know.
749659173353299968 Just watched @meetthepress and how totally biased against me Chuck Todd, and the entire show, is against me.The good news-the people get it!
749350193095667713 It was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton. Like I said, the system is totally rigged!
749341789102960640 It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. What she did was wrong! What Bill did was stupid!
749264697233383424 Thank you @greta. #ImWithYou
749264383990194176 Thank you for your support!
749261242137710592 If I become the next POTUS- they will not be ignoring! #AmericaFirst
749261175968436224 Crooked Hillary -- Makes History!
749240145442922496 The #2A to our Constitution is clear. The right of the people to keep & bear Arms shall not be infringed upon.
749209816732672000 The speakers slots at the Republican Convention are totally filled, with a long waiting list of those that want to speak - Wednesday release
749208070505586688 Just read in the failing @nytimes that I was not aware the event had to be held in Cleveland - a total lie. These people are sick!
749052325130534912 When you can't say it - or see it -- you can't fix it. We will MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN! #ImWithYou #AmericaFirst
749049896431415296 Just returned from Colorado. Amazing crowd!
748966167549603840 Thank you for inviting me to the Western Conservative Summit in Colorado! #ImWithYou #WCS16
748926103931150336 Thank you for your support! We will MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN! #ImWithYou #AmericaFirst
748920081942327296 These crimes won't be happening if I'm elected POTUS. Killer should have never been here. #AmericaFirst
748906952713875456 Yet another terrorist attack today in Israel -- a father, shot at by a Palestinian terrorist, was killed while:
748871858553024512 Horrible killing of a 13 year old American girl at her home in Israel by a Palestinian terrorist. We must get tough.
748869825208913921 @TraceAdkins great job on FOX this morning. Keep up the good work!
748851849185243136 Take a look at what happened w/ Bill Clinton. The system is totally rigged. Does anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence?
748851673313873920 Bill Clinton's meeting was a total secret. Nobody was to know about it but he was caught by a local reporter.
748851569190318080 As Bernie Sanders said, Hillary Clinton has bad judgement. Bill's meeting was probably initiated and demanded by Hillary!
748647669707350016 I will be interviewed by @SeanHannity tonight at 10pm on FOX! Enjoy!
748599711792234496 The reason I put up approximately $50 million for my successful primary campaign is very simple, I want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
748599572230975492 I have self funded my winning primary campaign with an approx. $50 million loan. I have totally terminated the loan!
748599438034206720 The very dishonest @NBCNews refuses to accept the fact that I have forgiven my $50 million loan to my campaign. Done deal!
748599094252273664 One of the reasons Hillary hid her emails was so the public wouldn't see how she got rich- selling out America.
748590222988947457 Why would college graduates want Crooked Hillary as their President? She will destroy them!
748569874042064900 New book by @ericbolling is absolutely terrific and a must read! #WakeUpAmerica
748528593634992128 The story with Hillary will never change.
748345210372038656 For reasons only they can explain, the @USChamber wants to continue our bad trade deals rather than renegotiating and making them better.
748343042994733056 Tremendous day in Massachusetts and Maine. Thank you to everyone for making it so special!
748289375801323520 I will be on @oreillyfactor at 8:00 P.M. Enjoy!
748219891577131010 ISIS exploded on Hillary Clinton's watch- she's done nothing about it and never will. Not capable!
748166232298381312 Will be in Bangor, Maine today! Join me- 4pmE at the Cross Insurance Center!
748163921383723008 New Q poll out- we are going to win the whole deal- and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! #Trump2016
748163517455413248 Just watched Senator John Barrasso on @FoxNews - He was great! Thank you John.
748142709932756992 Why would the USChamber be upset by the fact that I want to negotiate better and stronger trade deals or that I want penalties for cheaters?
748141420528140288 The @USCHAMBER must fight harder for the American worker. China, and many others, are taking advantage of U.S. with our terrible trade pacts
747986907162877952 Iron Mike Tyson was not asked to speak at the Convention though I'm sure he would do a good job if he was. The media makes everything up!
747900114363092992 We must do everything possible to keep this horrible terrorism outside the United States.
747899586593890309 Yet another terrorist attack, this time in Turkey. Will the world ever realize what is going on? So sad.
747888895581372416 Hillary Clinton's Presidency would be catastrophic for the future of our country. She is ill-fit with bad judgment.
747888354126069761 Benghazi is just another Hillary Clinton failure. It just never seems to work the way it's supposed to with Clinton.
747874856130183168 Check it out - 2nd video on Lying Crooked Hillary is now online! Watch it here:
747424042181791744 @CNN is all negative when it comes to me. I don't watch it anymore.
747418754255052802 The media is unrelenting. They will only go with and report a story in a negative light. I called Brexit (Hillary was wrong), watch November
747415955400196096 Crooked Hillary is wheeling out one of the least productive senators in the U.S. Senate, goofy Elizabeth Warren, who lied on heritage.
747206160806219776 The dirty poll done by @ABC @washingtonpost is a disgrace. Even they admit that many more Democrats were polled. Other polls were good.
747194865633595392 Crooked Hillary Attacks Foreign Government Donations - While Ignoring Her Own:
747191624535511040 Crooked Hillary Clinton got Brexit wrong. I said LEAVE will win. She has no sense of markets and such bad judgement. Only a question of time
747190075344162817 Hillary Clinton is not a change agent, just the same old status quo! She is spending a fortune, I am spending very little. Close in polls!
747178078682644480 People in our country want borders, and without them the old line pols like Crooked Hillary will not win. It is time for CHANGE -- and JOBS!
747105049352888320 Top 50 Facts About Crooked Hillary Clinton From Trump 'Stakes Of The Election' Address:
747102432862273536 The @ABC poll sample is heavy on Democrats. Very dishonest - why would they do that? Other polls good!
747098691492786176 Crooked Hillary just took a major ad of me playing golf at Turnberry. Shows me hitting shot, but I never did = lie! Was there to support son
747030708678430720 Clinton is trying to wash away her bad judgement call on BREXIT with big dollar ads. Disgraceful!
747029963702996992 Crooked Hillary Clinton, who called BREXIT 100% wrong (along with Obama), is now spending Wall Street money on an ad on my correct call.
747027629652443136 George Will, one of the most overrated political pundits (who lost his way long ago), has left the Republican Party.He's made many bad calls
746908869134262272 Just landed in New York - a one night stay in Scotland. Turnberry came out magnificently. My son, Eric, did a great job - under budget!
746895785338544128 Obama has blocked ICE officers and BP from doing their jobs. That ends when I am President!
746895602798178304 I have never liked the media term 'mass deportation' -- but we must enforce the laws of the land!
746895252884164608 We only want to admit those who love our people and support our values. #AmericaFirst
746895065591783424 We must suspend immigration from regions linked with terrorism until a proven vetting method is in place.
746734772928528384 Thank you to everyone who came out & joined us @TrumpTurnberry yesterday! @EricTrump @IvankaTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr
746721493061632000 On the 13th tee box @TrumpScotland with my grand daughter, Kai! @DonaldJTrumpJr
746718385828859904 Arriving @TrumpScotland with @DonaldJTrumpJr & @EricTrump. Back to New York tonight.
746674420605980672 So funny, Crooked Hillary called BREXIT so incorrectly, and now she says that she is the one to deal with the U.K. All talk, no action!
746560976921706500 Thoughts and prayers are with everyone in West Virginia- dealing with the devastating floods. #ImWithYou
746458701565988864 Many people are equating BREXIT, and what is going on in Great Britain, with what is happening in the U.S. People want their country back!
746456564337344512 The opening of Trump Turnberry in Scotland was a big success. Good timing, I was here for BREXIT. Very exciting news conference today!
746453765935366144 Crooked Hillary called it totally wrong on BREXIT - she went with Obama - and now she is saying we need her to lead. She would be a disaster
746415333741756418 I want all Americans to succeed together. President Obama's illegal executive amnesty undermines job prospects for...
746414797416243200 New Government data by the Center for Immigration Studies shows more than 3M new legal & illegal immigrants settled..
746289768707698688 America is proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder w/a free & ind UK. We stand together as friends, as allies, & as a people w/a shared history.
746289394231828480 Self-determination is the sacred right of all free people's, and the people of the UK have exercised that right for all the world to see.
746273889160957952 Getting ready to open the magnificent Turnberry in Scotland. What a great day, especially when added to the brave & brilliant vote.
746273866322829312 Statement Regarding British Referendum on E.U. Membership
746272130992644096 Just arrived in Scotland. Place is going wild over the vote. They took their country back, just like we will take America back. No games!
746145338608713728 Congratulations to my son, Eric, on the fantastic job he has done in rebuilding Turnberry, and its great Ailsa Course. Always support kids!
746144027616120833 Leaving now for a one night trip to Scotland in order to be at the Grand Opening of my great Turnberry Resort. Will be back on Sat. night!
746094507201077248 Meet the amazing mother whose letter I read during my speech. She lost her son to policies supported by Clinton.
746072493950107650 Read my full statement here on the Supreme Court's executive amnesty decision #imwithyou
746064216373731328 Here is another CNN lie. The Clinton News Network is losing all credibility. I'm not watching it much anymore.
746063926597672960 CNN, which is totally biased in favor of Clinton, should apologize. They knew they were wrong.
746057926800977920 Our inner cities have been left behind. We will never have the resources to support our people if we have an open border.
746052286640689157 On immigration, I'm consulting with our immigration officers & our wage-earners. Hillary Clinton is consulting with Wall Street.
746047705709961216 Obama & Clinton should stop meeting with special interests, & start meeting with the victims of illegal immigration.
746044729343741956 Hillary Clinton's open borders are tearing American families apart. I am going to make our country Safe Again for all Americans. #Imwithyou
746042076211593216 SC has kept us safe from exec amnesty--for now. But Hillary has pledged to expand it, taking jobs from Hispanic & African-American workers.
746026900502487040 Hillary Lies to Benghazi Families
745969778267926532 ISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made along with President Obama. -- Donald J. Trump
745969049943875585 Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency. -- Donald J. Trump
745967990236143616 Thank you to Donald Rumsfeld for the endorsement. Very much appreciated. Clinton's conduct has been disqualifying.
745693029089034240 Hillary says things can't change. I say they have to change. It's a choice between Americanism and her corrupt globalism. #Imwithyou
745455382882033664 Crooked Hillary refuses to say that she will be raising taxes beyond belief! She will be a disaster for jobs and the economy!
745356618125152256 I will be interviewed by @LouDobbs tonight on @FoxBusiness 7pm ET
745305119256875008 Hillary defrauded America as Secy of State. She used it as a personal hedge fund to get herself rich! Corrupt, dangerous, dishonest.
745304731346702336 If you want to know about Hillary Clinton's honesty & judgment, ask the family of Ambassador Stevens.
745304333483393024 Hillary took money and did favors for regimes that enslave women and murder gays.
745299161130635264 I am the king of debt.That has been great for me as a businessman, but is bad for the country. I made a fortune off of debt, will fix U.S.
745298514096308225 Obama-Clinton inherited $10T in debt and turned it into nearly $20T. They have bankruptedÃ¢Â¦
745296338758270976 Hillary Clinton's open borders immigration policies will drive down wages for all Americans - and make everyone less safe.
745295914076672001 How can Hillary run the economy when she can't even send emails without putting entire nation at risk?
745294739092684800 Hillary Clinton surged the trade deficit with China 40% as Secretary of State, costing Americans millions of jobs.
745294375584956416 Hillary says this election is about judgment. She's right. Her judgement has killed thousands, unleashed ISIS and wrecked the economy.
745260520282951681 I will be making a big speech tomorrow to discuss the failed policies and bad judgment of Crooked Hillary Clinton.
745204320593940480 Crooked Hillary Clinton is totally unfit to be our president-really bad judgement and a temperament, according to new book, which is a mess!
744838252369043456 When I said that if, within the Orlando club, you had some people with guns, I was obviously talking about additional guards or employees
744701872456536064 @DJohnsonPGA We are so proud of you Dustin. Your reaction under pressure was amazing. First of many Majors. You are a true CHAMPION!
744364393962569728 Yesterday's failing @NYTimes fraudulently shows an empty room prior to my speech, when in fact, it was packed!
744363535635996672 How can the NY Times show an empty room hours before my speech even started when they knew it was going to be packed? So totally dishonest!
744355251365511169 Donald Trump's Speech Is a Game Changer. #Trump2016
744341058109247488 See you soon Arizona! #Trump2016

743076652662431744 The press is so totally biased that we have no choice but to take our tough but fair and smart message directly to the people!
743075154507489280 An: Media fell all over themselves criticizing what DonaldTrump may have insinuated about @POTUS. But he's right:
742909628338601985 Thank you Greensboro, North Carolina! Will be back soon! #AmericaFirst

742694780933656576 American must now get very tough, very smart and very vigilant. We cannot admit people into our country without extraordinary screening.
742512112614944768 Join me in Atlanta on Wednesday- at noon! #Trump2016
742470476824477696 Crooked Hillary says we must call on Saudi Arabia and other countries to stop funding hate. I am calling on- cont'd:
742469778560929793 Saudi Arabia and many of the countries that gave vast amounts of money to the Clinton Foundation- cont'd:
742464647878561794 I thought people weren't celebrating? They were cheering all over, even this savage from Orlando. I was right.
742464168482201602 In my speech on protecting America I spoke about a temporary ban, which includes suspending immigration from nations tied to Islamic terror.
742456254837215232 Based on the incredibly inaccurate coverage and reporting of the record setting Trump campaign, we are hereby:
742455297059475456 I am no fan of President Obama, but to show you how dishonest the phony Washington Post is:
742437914731286530 TERRORISM, IMMIGRATION, AND NATIONAL SECURITY SPEECH- TRANSCRIPT:
742418415047090176 Congratulations to the 2016 #StanleyCup Champions, Pittsburgh @Penguins!
742373042140123137 I am watching @FoxNews and how fairly they are treating me and my words, and @CNN, and the total distortion of my words and what I am saying
742371820867878913 I will be going to New Hampshire today, home of my first primary victory, to discuss terror and the horrible events of yesterday. 2:30 P.M.
742370798850199552 I have been hitting Obama and Crooked Hillary hard on not using the term Radical Islamic Terror. Hillary just broke-said she would now use!
742096033207844864 What has happened in Orlando is just the beginning. Our leadership is weak and ineffective. I called it and asked for the ban. Must be tough
742066996767031296 Reporting that Orlando killer shouted Allah hu Akbar! as he slaughtered clubgoers. 2nd man arrested in LA with rifles near Gay parade.
742053354189299712 Is President Obama going to finally mention the words radical Islamic terrorism? If he doesn't he should immediately resign in disgrace!
742034549232766976 Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don't want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance. We must be smart!
742019961946791939 Horrific incident in FL. Praying for all the victims & their families. When will this stop? When will we get tough, smart & vigilant?
741988371174699009 Clinton made a false ad about me where I was imitating a reporter GROVELING after he changed his story. I would NEVER mock disabled. Shame!
741965111968075776 Really bad shooting in Orlando. Police investigating possible terrorism. Many people dead and wounded.
741774067368402945 Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, pretended to be a Native American in order to advance her career. Very racist!
741760911044685824 Riley Rone was a great young man. We will miss him dearly.

741744258655387648 Thank you Tampa, Florida!
741696814194274304 Sad case- @USATODAY did article saying I don't pay bills- false, only don't pay when work is shoddy, bad, or not done! They should do same!
741645740884303872 In Tampa, Florida- thank you to all of our outstanding volunteers who want to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!
741600981251657728 Don King, and so many other African Americans who know me well and endorsed me, would not have done so if they thought I was a racist!
741590381503086592 Mitt Romney had his chance to beat a failed president but he choked like a dog. Now he calls me racist-but I am least racist person there is
741487809576439811 Thank you Richmond, Virginia!

741311272818475008 I rarely agree with President Obama- however he is 100% correct about Crooked Hillary Clinton. Great ad!
741301954324910080 Pocahontas describing Crooked Hillary Clinton as a Corporate Donor Puppet. Time for change! #Trump2016
741297855168716801 Heading to D.C. to speak at Faith and Freedom Coalition and visit OPO.
741292912894431232 Donald Trump Plans To Continue GOP Legacy Of Leading On Women's, Civil Rights Against Racist, Sexist Democrats
741286391200505857 The great boxing promoter, Don King, just endorsed me. Nice!
741257031722622976 6/10: Richmond, VA - 8pm 6/11: Tampa, FL - 11am 6/11: Pittsburgh, PA - 3pm 6/13: Portsmouth, NH - 2:30pm
741240449906663424 Pocahontas is at it again! Goofy Elizabeth Warren, one of the least productive U.S. Senators, has a nasty mouth. Hope she is V.P. choice.
741015811960229893 Thank you Roseanne, very much appreciated.
741007091947556864 How long did it take your staff of 823 people to think that up--and where are your 33,000 emails that you deleted?
740988538464948224 A message of condolences and support regarding the terrorist attacks in Tel Aviv:
740972317191352320 Obama just endorsed Crooked Hillary. He wants four more years of ObamaÃ¢but nobody else does!
740883494117728256 Crooked Hillary Clinton will be a disaster on jobs, the economy, trade, healthcare, the military, guns and just about all else. Obama plus!
740879092141182976 As expected, the media is very much against me. Their dishonesty is amazing but, just like our big wins in the primaries, we will win!
740721589709328385 Bernie Sanders must really dislike Crooked Hillary after the way she played him. Many of his supporters, because of trade, will come to me.
740708673694076928 I would have had many millions of votes more than Crooked Hillary Clinton except for the fact that I had 16 opponents, she had one!
740641413335908352 MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
740515952454959104 Nobody is watching @Morning_Joe anymore. Gone off the deep end - bad ratings. You won't believe what I am watching now!
740511746503364608 Thank you to all for your wonderful comments on my speech. I could feel the electricity in thr air. Great reviews - most votes ever recieved

740313748825505792 Thank you! Together we will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!
740005642228862981 In just out book, Secret Service Agent Gary Byrne doesn't believe that Crooked Hillary has the temperament or integrity to be the president!
739998110915678208 A former Secret Service Agent for President Clinton excoriates Crooked Hillary describing her as ERRATIC & VIOLENT. Bad temperament for pres
739934090690998272 See, when I said NATO was obsolete because of no terrorism protection, they made the change without giving me credit.
739857123329335298 Thank you Diamond and Silk!
739826625546752000 Remembering the fallen heroes on #DDay - June 6, 1944.
739816997345755136 I am getting bad marks from certain pundits because I have a small campaign staff. But small is good, flexible, save money and number one!
739814823689605120 A massive blow to Obama's message - only 38,000 new jobs for month in just issued jobs report. That's REALLY bad!
739810044150190080 Crooked Hillary is being badly criticized (for a Wall Street paid for ad) by PolitiFact for a false ad on me on women. She is a total fraud!
739807883521630208 Crooked Hillary Clinton has not held a news conference in more than 7 months. Her record is so bad she is unable to answer tough questions!
739803054476775424 Just like I have been able to spend far less money than others on the campaign and finish #1, so too should our country. We can be great!
739779845572448256 People like @KatyTurNBC report on my campaign, but have zero access. They say what they want without any knowledge.True of so much of media!
739581318699352066 Hillary Clinton is unfit to be president. She has bad judgement, poor leadership skills and a very bad and destructive track record. Change!
739576535561162752 I am watching @CNN very little lately because they are so biased against me. Shows are predictable garbage! CNN and MSM is one big lie!
739571700392722432 The Clinton News Network, sometimes referred to as @CNN, is getting more and more biased.They act so indignant-hear them behind closed doors
739206145072594944 Thank you Attorney General Gonzales, so many people feel this way.
739082885857173505 We just had the worst jobs report since 2010.
739082059348619264 The Mayor of San Jose did a terrible job of ordering the protection of innocent people. The thugs were lucky supporters remained peaceful!
739080401747120128 Many of the thugs that attacked the peaceful Trump supporters in San Jose were illegals. They burned the American flag and laughed at police
738950669927886848 Muhammad Ali is dead at 74! A truly great champion and a wonderful guy. He will be missed by all!
738858013419835392 Thank you Redding, California!
738809335841595392 Great evening in San Jose other than the thugs. My supporters are far tougher if they want to be, but fortunately they are not hostile.
738808292550397953 So much interest in my visit to Scotland! I greatly look forward to attending the opening event @TrumpTurnberry- taking place on June 24th.
738762615334174720 I'm a former chief of police in a border town. I'm Hispanic, I'm proud to be Hispanic and I'm 100% behind Trump.
738720347239809024 In Crooked Hillary's telepromter speech yesterday, she made up things that I said or believe but have no basis in fact. Not honest!
738718346045063168 I don't watch or do @Morning_Joe anymore. Small audience, low ratings! I hear Mika has gone wild with hate. Joe is Joe. They lost their way!
738712803775631361 Rally last night in San Jose was great. Tremendous love and enthusiasm in the hall. Big crowd. Outside, small group of thugs burned Am flag!
738711092252155904 Terrible jobs report just reported. Only 38,000 jobs added. Bombshell!
738576654176387072 Then, on June 25th- back to the USA to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
738576553508929536 After @TrumpScotland, I will visit @TrumpDoonbeg in Ireland, the magnificent resort fronting on the Atlantic Ocean.
738576209726955524 After @TrumpTurnberry I will be visiting Aberdeen, the oil capital of Europe, to see my great club, @TrumpScotland.
738575853261574144 On June 22- I will be going to Scotland to celebrate the opening of the newly renovated @TrumpTurnberry Resort, the worlds best.
738575670771486721 Join me in Redding, California- tomorrow at 1:00pm. #Trump2016
738539023669465094 @Natalie_Gulbis- Thank you for the nice piece in @SInow / @Golf_com. Keep up the great work!
738494609597157376 A 60% increase in Texas Blue Cross/Blue Shield through ObamaCare. I told you so, there is panic and anger as healthcare costs explode!
738478522813972480 So great to have the endorsement and support of Paul Ryan. We will both be working very hard to Make America Great Again!
738449664752553984 Bad performance by Crooked Hillary Clinton! Reading poorly from the telepromter! She doesn't even look presidential!
738448988517453824 Crooked Hillary no longer has credibility - too much failure in office. People will not allow another four years of incompetence!
738416510092357632 Crooked Hillary Clinton, who I would love to call Lyin' Hillary, is getting ready to totally misrepresent my foreign policy positions.
738415541203832832 After the litigation is disposed of and the case won, I have instructed my execs to open Trump U(?), so much interest in it! I will be pres.
738413456118841345 Even though I have a very biased and unfair judge in the Trump U civil case in San Diego, I have thousands of great reviews & will win case!
738412068181676032 With all of the Crooked Hillary Clinton's foreign policy experience, she has made so many mistakes - and I mean real monsters! No more HRC.
738409191526662144 Join me in San Jose, California- tonight!
738407796606013444 Wow, USA Today did todays cover story on my record in lawsuits. Verdict: 450 wins, 38 losses. Isn't that what you want for your president?
738399082813620224 Do you ever notice that @CNN gives me very little proper representation on my policies. Just watched-nobody knew anything about my foreign P
738387288372051969 Bernie Sanders was right when he said that Crooked Hillary Clinton was not qualified to be president because she suffers from BAD judgement!
738385522301624323 Crooked Hillary Clinton has zero natural talent - she should not be president. Her temperament is bad and her decision making ability-zilch!
738233323344920576 Thank you Sacramento, California! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
738163472865759232 Same failing @nytimes reporter who wrote discredited women's story last week wrote another terrible story on me today- will never learn!
738132164399636480 Crooked Hillary Clinton is a fraud who has put the public and country at risk by her illegal and very stupid use of e-mails. Many missing!
738109521952833536 Join me in San Jose, California- tomorrow evening at 7pm!
737996614573260800 So I raised/gave $5,600,000 for the veterans and the media makes me look bad! They do anything to belittle - totally biased.
737785345459113985 Congratulations to @seanhannity on his tremendous increase in television ratings. Speaking of ratings- I will be on his show tonight @ 10pE.
737785114239864832 I am getting great credit for my press conference today. Crooked Hillary should be admonished for not having a press conference in 179 days.
737784398515441664 Katie Couric, the third rate reporter, who has been largely forgotten, should be ashamed of herself for the fraudulent editing of her doc.
737778668785766404 I will be interviewed on @seanhannity tonight at 10pmE on @FoxNews. Enjoy!
737753549564694528 Join me in Sacramento, California-tomorrow evening @ 7pm! #Trump2016
737689416811073536 So many veterans groups are beyond happy with all of the money I raised/gave! It was my great honor - they do an amazing job.
737688582849171456 Just finished a press conference in Trump Tower wherein I gave information on which VETERANS groups got the $5,600,000 that I raised/gave!
737610159459991552 I have raised/given a tremendous amount of money to our great VETERANS, and have got nothing but bad publicity for doing so. Watch!
737596690257969152 So many great things happening - new poll numbers looking good! News conference at 11:00 A.M. today, Trump Tower!
737402123453878272 I should have easily won the Trump University case on summary judgement but have a judge, Gonzalo Curiel, who is totally biased against me.
737399475509985280 I have a judge in the Trump University civil case, Gonzalo Curiel (San Diego), who is very unfair. An Obama pick. Totally biased-hates Trump
737376803514286081 I hope everyone had a great Memorial Day!
737376356795875330 I would have had millions of votes more in the primaries (than Crooked Hillary) if I only had one opponent, instead of sixteen. Broke record
737243856144629760 Have a great Memorial Day and remember that we will soon MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
737238518775320576 The endorsement of me by the 16,500 Border Patrol Agents was the first time that they ever endorsed a presidential candidate. Nice!
737237313034563585 In getting the endorsement of the 16,500 Border Patrol Agents (thank you), the statement was made that the WALL was very necessary!
737232540436664320 Obama says a WALL at our southern border won't enhance our security (wrong) and yet he now wants to build a much bigger wall (fence) at W.H.
737056428452630528 If dummy Bill Kristol actually does get a spoiler to run as an Independent, say good bye to the Supreme Court!
737055532960223233 The Republican Party has to be smart & strong if it wants to win in November. Can't allow lightweights to set up a spoiler Indie candidate!
737054226833149952 Bill Kristol has been wrong for 2yrs-an embarrassed loser, but if the GOP can't control their own, then they are not a party. Be tough, R's!
737036608915034112 Good news is that my campaign has perhaps more cash than any campaign in the history of politics- b/c I stand 100% behind everything we do.
736961734167146496 Heading to D.C. to see and hear ROLLING THUNDER. Amazing people that LOVE OUR COUNTRY. Great spirit!
736875933999697920 Honor Memorial Day by thinking of and respecting all of the great men and women that gave their lives for us and our country! We love them.
736672123012427776 Does President Obama ever discuss the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor while he's in Japan? Thousands of American lives lost. #MDW
736671884247478272 Don't believe the biased and phony media quoting people who work for my campaign. The only quote that matters is a quote from me!
736655485814857728 I am always on the front page of the failing @nytimes, but when I won the GOP nomination, I'm in the back of the paper. Very dishonest!
736655448993107968 The media is on a new phony kick about my management style. I spend much less money & get much better results! What we need as Prez!
736655375911530498 The failing @nytimes wrote a story about my management style & that I don't have many people. I have 73, Hillary has 800- & I'm beating her.
736569533738156036 I (we) broke the all-time record for most votes gotten in a Republican Primary - by a lot - and with many states left to go! Thank you.
736554410361409536 The U.S. has 69 treaties with other countries where we would have to defend them and their borders. How nice, but what do we get? NOT ENOUGH
736441853097218048 Great rally in Fresno, California- great crowd! Thank you! #Trump2016
736410143378792448 Obama administration fails to screen Syrian refugees' social media accounts:
736388616214220801 @SanDiegoPD- Fantastic job on handling the thugs who tried to disrupt our very peaceful and well attended rally. Greatly appreciated!
736381305785581568 Thank you @BillyJoel- many friends just told me you gave a very kind shoutout at MSG. Appreciate it- love your music!
736336185086222336 Wow- 25,000 in San Diego, California!
736336010808688640 I am on @oreillyfactor tonight, a big special. @FoxNews at 8:00 P.M. ENJOY!
736249593352966144 Bill O'Reilly doing a major special on @OreillyFactor tonight- @FoxNews at 8pmE. Watch it, should be good! #Trump2016
736197797314101248 AN AMERICA FIRST ENERGY PLAN
736016335197458434 Poll data shows that @marcorubio does by far the best in holding onto his Senate seat in Florida. Important to keep the MAJORITY. Run Marco!
735968169001684992 Today we, together, won the Republican Nomination for President!
735959405565378560 My wife @MELANIATRUMP, and my children will be featured on @FoxNews with @Greta- 7pmE. Enjoy!
735942401165033477 I find it offensive that Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, pretended to be Native American to get in Harvard.
735908158330130432 Thank you Mr. & Mrs. @TomBarrackJr for the wonderful and magical evening last night. It will not be forgotten. #Trump2016
735871869581205504 @kimguilfoyle- just watched you on @OutnumberedFNC- thank you!
735822406514675712 The Inspector General's report on Crooked Hillary Clinton is a disaster. Such bad judgement and temperament cannot be allowed in the W.H.
735611127531347969 Thank you Anaheim, California!
735541674793783297 Thank you Washington! Honored to say, on behalf of our great movement, we have broken the all time record for votes in GOP primary history.
735465352436408320 The protesters in New Mexico were thugs who were flying the Mexican flag. The rally inside was big and beautiful, but outside, criminals!
735459144287719425 Crooked Hillary Clinton just can't close the deal with Bernie. I had to knock out 16 very good and smart candidates. Hillary doesn't have it
735448311914602496 Goofy Senator Elizabeth Warren @elizabethforma has done less in the U.S. Senate than practically any other senator. All talk, no action!
735444721716199424 @elizabethforma Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes known as Pocahontas, bought foreclosed housing and made a quick killing. Total hypocrite!
735344013499326465 @elizabethforma Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas because she faked the fact she is native American, is a lowlife!
735337786757238785 Great rally in New Mexico, amazing crowd! Now in L.A. Big rally in Anaheim.
735311006826700800 Thank you Washington! #Trump2016
735267499269226496 Great honor to receive today's endorsement of @RickSantorum. Really nice! #Trump2016
735267332927279107 After raising, w/ no obligation, almost $6M for Vets, I couldn't believe protesters formed @ Trump Tower. JUST OUT- SENT BY CROOKED HILLARY!
735213812484345857 Thank you @DailyMail- for setting the failing @NYTimes story straight. This is what the NYT's should have written!
735125552064024577 A suggestion for the dishonest media-
735124106476195841 A wonderfully written article concerning Israel by @JasonDovEsq
735117032060899328 A great new book has been written about Crooked Hillary. Read it & you will never be able to vote for her. @Ed_Klein
735073508124983298 Crooked Hillary Clinton overregulates, overtaxes and doesn't care about jobs. Most importantly, she suffers from plain old bad judgement!
735058192862969856 I just released my financial disclosure forms, the largest numbers in the history of the F.E.C. Even the dishonest media thinks great!
734939680278519809 Amazingly, with all of the money I have raised for the vets, I have got nothing but bad publicity from the dishonest and disgusting media.
734938503541325825 Much of the money I have raised for our veterans has already been distributed, with the rest to go shortly to various other veteran groups.
734936659851128832 While under no obligation to do so, I have raised between 5 & 6 million dollars, including 1million dollars from me, for our VETERANS. Nice!
734903156589645824 Join me in California or Montana!
734892328637325312 I will be interviewed on @oreillyfactor at 8:00 P.M. Enjoy!
734794856564936705 Obama's VA Secretary just said we shouldn't measure wait times. Hillary says VA problems are not Ã¢widespread.' I will take care of
734768900282454016 Is Hillary really protecting women?
734742416494845952 In trade, military and EVERYTHING else, it will be AMERICA FIRST! This will quickly lead to our ultimate goal: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
734517899960934400 Thank you America! #Trump2016
734485185148944384 The American people are sick and tired of not being able to lead normal lives and to constantly be on the lookout for terror and terrorists!
734482099793711104 Bernie Sanders is continuing his quest because he believes that Crooked Hillary Clinton will be forced out of the race - e-mail scandal!
734470625767620609 Join me on Wednesday, May 25th at the Anaheim Convention Center!
734468447829004288 Crooked Hillary wants a radical 500% increase in Syrian refugees. We can't allow this. Time to get smart and protect America!
734468142303305728 How can Crooked Hillary say she cares about women when she is silent on radical Islam, which horribly oppresses women?
734395329588670465 Why do the networks continue to put dopey @BillKristol on panels when he has called every single shot about me wrong for 2 yrs?
734365143635759104 Hillary Clinton is not qualified to be president because her judgement has been proven to be so bad! Would be four more years of stupidity!
734231223002894337 Crooked Hillary said that I want guns brought into the school classroom. Wrong!
734114828529307648 Thank you to all of the men and women who have served our country. You are our true heroes! #ArmedForcesDay
734066896794963968 Crooked Hillary Clintons foreign interventions unleashed ISIS in Syria, Iraq and Libya. She is reckless and dangerous!
734066397425307648 MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
734053246734499840 @CNN is so negative, getting even worse as I get closer. Just had two anti-Trump losers with zero rebuttal from my team. Turning off!
734003305819570176 Crooked Hillary wants to get rid of all guns and yet she is surrounded by bodyguards who are fully armed. No more guns to protect Hillary!
733974704445358080 While our wonderful president was out playing golf all day, the TSA is falling apart, just like our government! Airports a total disaster!
733838909805887488 Crooked Hillary is spending tremendous amounts of Wall Street money on false ads against me. She is a very dishonest person!
733837704312410112 Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to essentially abolish the 2nd Amendment. No gun owner can ever vote for Clinton!
733820785157132288 Thank you @TheTodaysGolfer for the wonderful statement that the new par 3 9th hole @Trump Turnberry could be the most dramatic in Britain.
733803565060345856 @montgomeriefdn Colin, great to have you at Trump Turnberry. So proud of you and your GREAT playing! You made winning MAJORS look easy!
733791992564617216 Thank you for your wonderful endorsement today @TGowdySC. It means a great deal to me. We will not disappoint! #Trump2016
733778244076507136 Great day in Kentucky with Wayne LaPierre, Chris Cox & the @NRA!
733750845280522242 Thank you! An honor to be the first candidate ever endorsed by the @NRA- prior to @GOPconvention! #Trump2016 #2A
733691591198703616 Failing @NYTimes will always take a good story about me and make it bad. Every article is unfair and biased. Very sad!
733691067829215232 Trump is the most unpredictable, extraordinary, entertaining&massively popular candidate this country has ever seen.
733682878278696960 Crooked Hillary Clinton- discussing the #SecondAmendment at a private event. #2A cc: @NRA
733677446235623425 I am on my way! See you all soon!
733666112563519489 A Call for Unity by Jason Greenblatt @JasonDovEsq
733604767612710912 Crooked Hillary can't even close the deal with Bernie - and the Dems have it rigged in favor of Hillary. Four more years of this? No way!
733600358501625857 Crooked Hillary Clinton looks presidential? I don't think so! Four more years of Obama and our country will never come back. ISIS LAUGHS!
733597831261499392 Look where the world is today, a total mess, and ISIS is still running around wild. I can fix it fast, Hillary has no chance!
733594906447372292 Crooked Hillary has zero imagination and even less stamina. ISIS, China, Russia and all would love for her to be president. 4 more years!
733593259423862785 I said that Crooked Hillary Clinton is not qualified to be president because she has very bad judgement - Bernie said the same thing!
733380950059581440 Thank you @LtStevenLRogers. We will respond to terrorism with strength in 2017!
733348895615528960 How quality a woman is Rowanne Brewer Lane to have exposed the @nytimes as a disgusting fraud? Thank you Rowanne.
733242745385537536 Looks like yet another terrorist attack. Airplane departed from Paris. When will we get tough, smart and vigilant? Great hate and sickness!
733128160603168768 My list of potential U.S. Supreme Court Justices was very well recieved. During the next number of weeks I may be adding to the list!
733113480207798272 Some low-life journalist claims that I made a pass at her 29 years ago. Never happened! Like the @nytimes story which has become a joke!
732990965426888705 Thank you Louisiana! #Trump2016
732988705531650048 Thank you Arizona! See you soon!
732973805354819586 Why did Clinton supporter @AlisonForKY declare Crooked Hillary winner in KY when AP hasn't even called the race?
732893573365010432 Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Democrats - the system is rigged against him. Many of his disenfranchised fans are for me!
732788306237345794 Paul Begala, the dopey @CNN flunky and head of the Pro-Hillary Clinton Super PAC, has knowingly committed fraud in his first ad against me.
732773906889736192 Congratulations to THE MOVEMENT, we have just won THE GREAT STATE OF OREGON. The vote percentage is even higher than anticipated! Thank you.
732771469281927169 Thank you Oregon! #Trump2016
732762160842039296 Michael Barbaro, the author of the now discredited @nytimes hit piece on me with women, has in past tweeted badly about me. He should resign
732751047022628865 I look so forward to debating Crooked Hillary Clinton! Democrat Primaries are rigged, e-mail investigation is rigged - so time to get it on!
732749934903087104 I can't believe that @CNN would allow the very nice Jeffrey Lord to be savaged by a panel of seven Trump haters. 7 to 1 - Don't watch CNN!
732738568725094402 Well, that is it. Well done Megyn --- and they all lived happily ever after! Now let us all see how THE MOVEMENT does in Oregon tonight!
732736781351849989 Will go back on for a final question now!
732735764585406465 I like Michael Douglas!
732719796077383680 I will be live tweeting @megynkelly Show in 10 minutes. Should be interesting. Will be on Fox Network! ENJOY!
732717975090909185 Wall Street paid for ad is a fraud, just like Crooked Hillary! Their main line had nothing to do with women, and they knew it. Apologize?
732716604027502592 Do you think Crooked Hillary will finally close the deal? If she can't win Kentucky, she should drop out of race. System rigged!
732681922644725760 I will be live tweeting my interview with @megynkelly on the Fox Network tonight at 8! Enjoy!
732592935980695558 I look forward to watching @megynkelly tonight, 8 PM ET. It will be interesting to see how she treats meÃ¢I think she will be very fair.
732576889538260992 How can Crooked Hillary put her husband in charge of the economy when he was responsible for NAFTA, the worst economic deal in U.S. history?
732575682367258624 Crooked Hillary said her husband is going to be in charge of the economy.If so, he should run,not her.Will he bring the energizer to D.C.?
732570904094347265 #VoteTrump at clerk's offices & 185 ballot drop boxes in #ORPrimary!
732549197539446784 Crooked Hillary can't close the deal with Bernie Sanders. Will be another bad day for her!
732540713678819328 Amazing that Crooked Hillary can do a hit ad on me concerning women when her husband was the WORST abuser of woman in U.S. political history
732539159659859968 Oregon is voting today. Keep the big numbers going - VOTE TRUMP! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
732537744195522560 Crooked Hillary Clinton put out an ad where I am misquoted on women. Can't believe she would misrepresent the facts! My hit was on China
732535400498143232 The pathetic new hit ad against me misrepresents the final line. You can tell them to go BLANK themselves - was about China, NOT WOMEN!
732533409285865473 Wow, 30,000 e-mails were deleted by Crooked Hillary Clinton. She said they had to do with a wedding reception. Liar! How can she run?
732421072037892101 What Barbara Res does not say is that she would call my company endlessly, and for years, trying to come back. I said no.
732417001965137920 I gave a woman named Barbara Res a top N.Y. construction job, when that was unheard of, and now she is nasty. So much for a nice thank you!
732377163505225728 In politics, and in life, ignorance is not a virtue. This is a primary reason that President Obama is the worst president in U.S. history!
732333772587302912 The writer of the now proven false story in the @nytimes, Michael Barbaro, who was interviewed on CBS this morning, was unable to respond.
732333383024582661 Over 50 women were interviewed by the @nytimes yet they only wrote about 6. That's because there were so many positive statements.
732333137326444544 No wonder the @nytimes is failingÃ¢who can believe what they write after the false, malicious & libelous story they did on me.
732333025325928448 The failing @nytimes is greatly embarrassed by the totally dishonest story they did on my relationship with women.
732327433957953537 Rowanne Brewer, the most prominently depicted woman in the failing @nytimes story yesterday joined @foxandfriends.
732274340188852224 Thank you, Anthony @Scaramucci @WSJ The Entrepreneur's Case for Trump
732230384071680001 With the coming forward today of the woman central to the failing @nytimes hit piece on me, we have exposed the article as a fraud!
732200012457906176 A political commentator for @cnn, which I no longer watch, said Trump showed some weakness in the Repub Primaries. I set all-time record!
732197065820913668 Wow, Rowanne Brewer, the most prominently depicted woman in the failing @nytimes story yesterday, was on @foxandfriends saying Times lied
732196260636151808 The @nytimes is so dishonest. Their hit piece cover story on me yesterday was just blown up by Rowanne Brewer, who said it was a lie!
732163930236260352 That was an amazing interview on @foxandfriends - I hope the rest of the media picks it up to show how totally dishonest the @nytimes is!
732148805118885889 Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Dems. The system is rigged against him. He should run as an independent! Run Bernie, run.
732033604709191680 Great new poll- thank you!
732019210185003009 The @washingtonpost report on potential VP candidates is wrong. Marco Rubio and most others mentioned are NOT under consideration.
731959001143988229 Thank you Georgia! See you soon!
731928825500717057 The media is really on a witch-hunt against me. False reporting, and plenty of it - but we will prevail!
731924988060651520 Why did the failing @nytimes refuse to use any of the names given to them that I was so proud to have helped with their careers. DISHONEST!
731923681522397184 Wow, I have had so many calls from high ranking people laughing at the stupidity of the failing @nytimes piece. Massive front page for that!
731809410578808832 Why doesn't the failing @nytimes write the real story on the Clintons and women? The media is TOTALLY dishonest!
731804642368212992 Everyone is laughing at the @nytimes for the lame hit piece they did on me and women.I gave them many names of women I helped-refused to use
731800205188796419 The failing @nytimes wrote yet another hit piece on me. All are impressed with how nicely I have treated women, they found nothing. A joke!
731798661580111872 Thank you for the nice words this morning @KellyRiddell. Well delivered and totally logical! @CNN @FoxNews
731503361774768129 Wow, @CNN is really working hard to make me look as bad as possible. Very unprofessional. Hurting in ratings - bad television!
731501778873749505 Great new poll- thank you!
731288678451019776 If Crooked Hillary Clinton can't close the deal on Crazy Bernie, how is she going to take on China, Russia, ISIS and all of the others?
731220438530052096 An incredible honor to receive the endorsement of a person I have such tremendous respect for. Thank you, Sheldon!
731192363809394688 @thehill Your story about me & the carbon tax is absolutely incorrectÃ¢it is just the opposite. I will not support or endorse a carbon tax!
730948897435176961 Senator Lindsey Graham called me yesterday, very much to my surprise, and we had a very interesting talk about national security, and more!
730840541248819203 Great meeting with @SenateMajLdr Mitch McConnell and Republican leaders in D.C. #Trump2016
730823012463742976 Great day in D.C. with @SpeakerRyan and Republican leadership. Things working out really well! #Trump2016
730504511291265024 If it were up to goofy Elizabeth Warren, we'd have no jobs in AmericaÃ¢she doesn't have a clue.
730500562022760448 In interview I told @AP that my taxes are under routine audit and I would release my tax returns when audit is complete, not after election!
730498173492445184 Isn't it funny when a failed Senator like goofy Elizabeth Warren can spend a whole day tweeting about Trump & gets nothing done in Senate?
730493295550468096 Goofy Elizabeth Warren lied when she says I want to abolish the Federal Minimum Wage. See mediaÃ¢asking for increase!
730488544700010496 Our Native American Senator, goofy Elizabeth Warren, couldn't care less about the American workerÃ¢Â¦does nothing to help!
730482068753424385 Goofy Elizabeth Warren is now using the woman's card like her friend crooked Hillary. See her dumb tweet when a woman stands up to youÃ¢Â¦
730477118786801669 If the people of Massachusetts found out what an ineffective Senator goofy Elizabeth Warren has been, she would lose!
730445388856098817 Goofy Elizabeth Warren didn't have the guts to run for POTUS. Her phony Native American heritage stops that and VP cold.
730401662574182405 Goofy Elizabeth Warren has been one of the least effective Senators in the entire U.S. Senate. She has done nothing!
730343346204508160 I don't want to hit Crazy Bernie Sanders too hard yet because I love watching what he is doing to Crooked Hillary. His time will come!
730342411835195393 Big wins in West Virginia and Nebraska. Get ready for November - Crooked Hillary, who is looking very bad against Crazy Bernie, will lose!
730187041825120257 Thank you West Virginia!
730118084040724482 The Clintons spend millions on negative ads on me & I can't tell the truth about her husband? Don't feel sorry for crooked Hillary!
730089913778065408 Hillary has bad judgment!
730083435147055104 It was so great being in Nebraska last week. Today is the big day--get out and vote!
730069558132932609 I look very much forward to meeting w/Paul Ryan & the GOP Party Leadership on Thurs in DC. Together, we will beat the Dems at all levels!
730059920280793088 Via @JTAnews and Jason Greenblatt Donald Trump is a Visionary With Talents Our Country Needs @JasonDovEsq
730054891897536514 WEST VIRGINIA #VoteTrump TODAY!
730035627945775104 It is only the people that were never asked to be VP that tell the press that they will not take the position.
730034041760690176 It was Rosie O'Donnell who ate the cake in the vicious Hillary commercial about me, not Crooked Hillary! @marthamaccallum
730018836808933376 Why does the media, with a strong push from Crooked Hillary, keep pushing the false narrative that I want to raise taxes. Exactly opposite!
729997397884047360 . #RepMikeKelly Great job on @foxandfriends this morning. Thank you for the nice words!
729981270328000512 Get out and vote Nebraska, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
729979461404340224 Get out and vote West Virginia, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
729775453704179713 Thank you Jason Greenblatt @JasonDovEsq For Our Children: Let's Elect Donald Trump
729722941521469442 I am lowering taxes far more than any other candidate. Any negotiated increase by Congress to my proposal would still be lower than current!
729717317467246592 I will have set the all time record in primary votes in the Republican party --despite having to compete against 17 other people!
729717006749052928 If I only had 1 person running against me in the primaries like Hillary Clinton, I would have gotten 10 million more votes than she did!
729716712124362754 Crooked Hillary Clinton says that she got more primary votes than Donald Trump. But I had 17 people to beatÃ¢she had one!
729635334116544512 Will be interviewed by @MariaBartiromo on @FoxBizAlert at 7:30 A.M. Enjoy!
729621735717351424 Wow, I hear @Morning_Joe has gone really hostile ever since I said I won't do or watch the show anymore.They misrepresent my positions!
729618676748570625 I will be interviewed on @CNN at 7:00 A.M.
729613336191586304 @drmoore Russell Moore is truly a terrible representative of Evangelicals and all of the good they stand for. A nasty guy with no heart!
729605529417465856 I will be interviewed on @NewDay @CNN at 7:00 A.M.
729604845716516864 I will win the election against Crooked Hillary despite the people in the Republican Party that are currently and selfishly opposed to me!
729492093522067456 On @seanhannity show @FoxNews now. ENJOY!
729404337164783617 Crooked Hillary just can't close the deal with Bernie. It will be the same way with ISIS, and China on trade, and Mexico at the border. Bad!
729332727665790976 @KellyannePolls Kellyanne, you were fantastic on @meetthepress today. Keep going - I will win for the people. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
729301847031349250 I will be interviewed on @meetthepress this morning. Enjoy!
729301192325668864 I will be interviewed on This Week with George S this morning. Enjoy!
729121112148353025 @EdGoeas thank you for your support tonight on @JudgeJeanine.
729004564075012096 Remember when the two failed presidential candidates, Lindsey Graham and Jeb Bush, signed a binding PLEDGE? They broke the deal, no honor!
728976091428233216 I am honored that the great men and women of the @Teamsters have created a movement from within called Teamsters for Trump! Thank you.
728974420807581696 I am going to keep our jobs in the U.S., and totally rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. Crooked Hillary has no clue! @Teamsters
728971726533578753 Join me in Washington today!
728777599560892416 Goofy Elizabeth Warren is weak and ineffective. Does nothing. All talk, no action -- maybe her Native American name?
728777556804153346 Goofy Elizabeth Warren and her phony Native American heritage are on a Twitter rant. She is too easy! I'm driving her nuts.
728740257512992768 Crooked Hillary Clinton wants completely open borders. Millions of Democrats will run from her over this and support me.
728739851823153152 Just met with courageous family of Sarah Root in Nebraska. Sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant, but leaves behind amazing legacy.
728725179074023425 Goofy Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clinton's flunky, has a career that is totally based on a lie. She is not Native American.
728725098409164801 Let's properly check goofy Elizabeth Warren's records to see if she is Native American. I say she's a fraud!
728725020109877248 I hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate. I will defeat them both.
728651908563517440 I hear @JoeNBC of rapidly fading @Morning_Joe is pushing hard for a third party candidate to run. This will guarantee a Crooked Hillary win.
728646402985869312 Joe Scarborough initially endorsed Jeb Bush and Jeb crashed, then John Kasich and that didn't work. Not much power or insight!
728617415332999171 Thank you to teachers across America! When I become POTUS we will make education a far more important component of our life than it is now.
728564631313190912 Crooked Hillary has ZERO leadership ability. As Bernie Sanders says, she has bad judgement. Constantly playing the women's card - it is sad!
728557074163060736 Paul Ryan said that I inherited something very special, the Republican Party. Wrong, I didn't inherit it, I won it with millions of voters!
728531431824166912 So many great endorsements yesterday, except for Paul Ryan! We must put America first and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
728529524468682754 Governor Rick Perry said Donald Trump is one of the most talented people running for the Presidency I've ever seen. Thank you Rick!
728528466765844480 Unlike crooked Hillary Clinton, who wants to destroy all miners, I want wages to go up in America. We will do so by bringing back jobs!
728423832848044032 Thank you West Virginia. Let's keep it going. Go out and vote on Tuesday - we will win big. #Trump2016
728403179214376960 Can you believe Crooked Hillary said, We are going to put a whole lot of coal miners&coal companies out of business. She then apologized.
728365792077742080 Join me tomorrow! #Trump2016
728305900415533056 Bernie Sanders has been treated terribly by the DemocratsÃ¢both with delegates & otherwise. He should show them, & run as an Independent.
728297587418247168 Happy #CincoDeMayo! The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics!
728292625850208256 I will be interviewed by @BretBaier @SpecialReport at 6pm ET tonight @FoxNews
728230182981611520 Many reports that I will be attending the Alvarez/Khan fight this weekend in Vegas. Totally untrue! Unfortunately I have other plans.
727898352965259268 Join me in Charleston, WV - tomorrow!
727803179816062976 I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 7:30 A.M. Enjoy!

727796025247846400 I would rather run against Crooked Hillary Clinton than Bernie Sanders and that will happen because the books are cooked against Bernie!
727791165341356032 What a great evening we had. So interesting that Sanders beat Crooked Hillary. The dysfunctional system is totally rigged against him!
727709529358671873 @oreillyfactor Please correct, I WON Virginia!
727643544190636034 Thank you Indiana, we were just projected to be the winner. We have won in every category. You are very special people-I will never forget!
727637487871479808 Thank you Indiana! #Trump2016
727636035149139968 Lyin' Ted Cruz consistently said that he will, and must, win Indiana. If he doesn't he should drop out of the race-stop wasting time & money
727634574298255361 Wow, Lyin' Ted Cruz really went wacko today. Made all sorts of crazy charges. Can't function under pressure - not very presidential. Sad!
727565652253392897 MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
727540765765828609 Polls close at 6pm! #INPrimary #Trump2016 #VoteTrump

727142563010891776 I will be campaigning in Indiana all day. Things are looking great, and the support of Bobby Knight has been so amazing. Today will be fun!
727137190967435265 Everybody is talking about the protesters burning the American flags and proudly waving Mexican flags. I want America First - so do voters!
727095549703364608 Gov Mike Pence has just stated that Donald Trump has taken a strong stance on Hoosier jobs, and he thanks me! I will bring back jobs to USA.
727093442325680128 Crooked Hillary Clinton said she is used to dealing with men who get off the reservation. Actually, she has done poorly with such men!
727085972278677504 I will be interviewed on @CNN @NewDay at 7:30 A.M. Enjoy!
726918444931776512 Join me in Carmel, Indiana- tomorrow at 4pm! #INPrimary

726886198027935745 Thank you Terre Haute, Indiana!
726865339947073536 @KarlRove is a failed Jeb Bushy. Never says anything good & never will, even after I beat Hillary. Shouldn't be on the air!
726810772555350016 I am on @FoxNewsSunday with Chris Wallace- his 20th year anniversary with #FNS, throughout the day. Enjoy!
726806071210303488 Will be in Terre Haute, Indiana in a short while -- big rally! See you soon!
726800215718645760 I watched Sen. Graham @FaceTheNation. Why don't they say that I ran him out of the race like a little boy, and in the end he had no support?
726773001430163456 Thank you Indiana! #Trump2016
726609734653104129 I will be in Indiana on Sunday and Monday at four MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN rallies. See you there!
726555060306595841 Thank you @MikeOzanian for the nice comments on @FoxNews today. Great job!
726514136838975494 Trump locks down Delaware GOP delegates. #Trump2016 #MAGA
726461507601612800 The economy is bad and getting worse-almost ZERO growth this quarter. Nobody can beat me on the economy (and jobs). MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
726403534380478464 The protesters in California were thugs and criminals. Many are professionals. They should be dealt with strongly by law enforcement!
726246693759496192 @AC360 Anderson, so amazing. Your mother is, and always has been, an incredible woman!
726115856053211136 We are now at 1001 delegates. We will win on the first ballot and are not wasting time and effort on other ballots because system is rigged!
726079789182808065 Thank you Indiana! #Trump2016
726045073775828992 Crooked Hillary Clinton, perhaps the most dishonest person to have ever run for the presidency, is also one of the all time great enablers!
726008645473824768 Wow, the ridiculous deal made between Lyin'Ted Cruz and 1 for 42 John Kasich has just blown up. What a dumb deal - dead on arrival!
725903475133947904 Thank you Costa Mesa, California! 31,000 people tonight with thousands turned away. I will be back! #Trump2016

725796339255267328 Thank you Evansville, Indiana!
725722027173249024 Heading to rally with Bobby now! See you soon!
725677423195512833 So many false and phony T.V. commercials being broadcast in Indiana. Reminds me of Florida where thousands were put up-I won in a landslide!
725659482819297280 I will be in Evansville, Indiana, with the great Bobby Knight (who last night endorsed me) at 12:00 this afternoon. See you there!
725648706385633280 Lyin' Ted Cruz, who can never beat Hillary Clinton and has NO path to victory, has chosen a V.P.candidate who failed badly in her own effort
725637460504510464 I will be interviewed on the @TODAYshow at 7:00 A.M. this morning. Enjoy!
725636069010579457 Thank you to all for the wonderful reviews of my foreign policy speech. I will soon be speaking in great detail on numerous other topics!
725532457756405760 Getting the strong endorsement of the great coach, Bobby Knight, has been a highlight of my stay in Indiana. Big speech tomorrow with Bobby!
725524257883697152 I am in Indiana where we just had a great rally. Fantastic people! Staying at a Holiday Inn Express - new and clean, not bad!
725501700933586946 Thank you for the endorsement, Coach Bobby Knight! I will never forget it!

725022169806327808 Lets go Pennsylvania! #VoteTrump
725017409132855296 How bad is the New York TimesÃ¢the most inaccurate coverage constantly. Always trying to belittle. Paper has lost its way!
724996031033806849 Thank you for the incredible support- Melania, Barron, Ivanka, Jared, Tiffany, Don, Vanessa, Eric, and Lara!
724993336000532480 Bernie Sanders has been treated terribly by the DemocratsÃ¢both with delegates & otherwise. He should show them, and run as an Independent!
724954532522917888 Thank you @DonaldJTrumpJr & @EricTrump. #Trump2016
724942956306771968 MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
724911563405189121 The Cruz-Kasich pact is under great strain. This joke of a deal is falling apart, not being honored and almost dead. Very dumb!
724778089830580224 Thank you Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania!
724772013219405824 Get out and VOTE tomorrow! We will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! #CTPrimary #DEPrimary #MDPrimary #PAPrimary #RIPrimary

724718355102478336 Thank you Warwick, Rhode Island!
724633177692725254 On the way to the great state of Rhode Island- big rally. Then to Pennsylvania for rest of day and night!
724633058398375936 Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him. Typical politician - can't make a deal work.
724568416338759680 Shows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses.
724567219062059008 Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness!
724445148910915584 Lyin' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors & special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad!
724442801933565952 Wow, just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION!
724409389570994176 I am happy to hear how badly the @nytimes is doing. It is a seriously failing paper with readership which is way down. Becoming irrelevant!
724236857777762304 I will be in Maryland this afternoon for a major rally. Things are looking good for Tuesday!
724236172181049344 @AndreBauer Great job and advice on @CNN @jaketapper Thank you!
724055614498955265 @Borisep was great on @JudgeJeanine tonight. Very smart commentary that will prove to be correct!
724052308661772288 As soon as John Kasich is hit with negative ads, he will drop like a rock in the polls against Crooked Hillary Clinton. I will win!
724050713953861632 I had a great day campaigning in Connecticut. Looking for a big vote on Tuesday!
724039081420808192 Congratulations to @seanhannity on his great ratings and ratings increase as reported by the @AP today. Amazing job!
723972167893966848 Lynne Ryan -- just read your great story in the NY Times -- I am proud of you. Thanks!

723565939162275840 Thank you for the incredible support, Maryland! This is a movement!
723526822424678400 I met Prince on numerous occasions. He was an amazing talent and wonderful guy. He will be greatly missed!
723274222907301888 Cruz said Kasich should leave because he couldn't get to 1237. Now he can't get to 1237. Drop out LYIN' Ted.
723266899275091969 Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich have no path to victory. They should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify!
723094439485399040 Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race. He said Kasich should get out for same reason. I think both should get out!
723092613457448960 I will be doing the @TODAYshow with my wife, Melania, and the rest of my family in a major Town Hall. Hopefully, it will be fun! Enjoy.7A.M.

722802795720634368 Off to Indiana! #Trump2016
722767517349978112 Ted Cruz is mathematically out of winning the race. Now all he can do is be a spoiler, never a nice thing to do. I will beat Hillary!
722635529708285952 MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
722626421231890432 Thank you New York, I will never forget!
722592772096724997 Thank you New York! I love you!
722589315923054592 @CNN is so negative it is impossible to watch. Terrible panel, angry haters. Bill O @oreillyfactor said such an amazing thing about me!

722266479660556289 Thank you Buffalo! #NYPrimary
722181629528141824 Lyin' Ted Cruz even voted against Superstorm Sandy aid and September 11th help. So many New Yorkers devastated. Cruz hates New York!
722120138057740288 New York, we will make America great again!
722017428520243201 Kasich only looks O.K. in polls against Hillary because nobody views him as a threat and therefore have placed ZERO negative ads against him
722016321119121409 Lyin' Ted Cruz can't win with the voters so he has to sell himself to the bosses-I am millions of VOTES ahead! Hillary would destroy him & K
721836860356628482 Thank you for today's endorsement, New York Veteran Police Association!
721805701325172736 Thank you, California! Will see you soon! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
721708342838747136 I would have millions of votes more than Hillary except for the fact that I had 17 opponents and she just had a socialist named Bernie!
721695114943442946 Crooked Hillary Clinton is spending a fortune on ads against me. I am the one person she doesn't want to run against. Will be such fun!
721694330805755904 Lyin' Ted Cruz can't get votes (I am millions ahead of him) so he has to get his delegates from the Republican bosses. It won't work!
721693297429901312 Lyin' Ted Cruz will never be able to beat Hillary. Despite a rigged delegate system, I am hundreds of delegates ahead of him.
721691854849318912 I'll be in one of my favorite places this morning, Staten Island. Big crowd, will be fun!
721495328097042432 Thank you California, Connecticut, Maryland, and Pennsylvania!

720464540375375873 Big protest march in Colorado on Friday afternoon! Don't let the bosses take your vote!
720460065958989827 The rules DID CHANGE in Colorado shortly after I entered the race in June because the pols and their bosses knew I would win with the voters
720458178698338304 Biggest story in politics is now happening in the great State of Colorado where over one million people have been precluded from voting!
720417893696040960 Will be interviewed by @SeanHannity on @FoxNews tonight at 10pm from Pennsylvania. Enjoy! #Trump2016

719648132225699840 A very interesting piece, by a very good writer, @KirstenPowers of @USATODAY and @FoxNews.
719630850716000257 Leaving for Albany, New York now, massive crowd expected. Very exciting!
719630780499128320 Why does the liberal media think Bill O'Reilly (@oreillyfactor) is a complete and total vulgarian? I don't think so!
719626295248863232 Colorado Trump Delegates Scratched from Ballots at GOP Convention
719548022871482370 This is happening all over our countryÃ¢great people being disenfranchised by politicians. Repub party is in trouble!
719476340576100353 I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 7:00 A.M. Enjoy!
719326834538778625 The people of Colorado had their vote taken away from them by the phony politicians. Biggest story in politics. This will not be allowed!
719321288301486081 How is it possible that the people of the great State of Colorado never got to vote in the Republican Primary? Great anger - totally unfair!
719159990834081794 I win a state in votes and then get non-representative delegates because they are offered all sorts of goodies by Cruz campaign. Bad system!
719158083684069376 The @nytimes purposely covers me so inaccurately. I want other nations to pay the U.S. for our defense of them. We are the suckers-no more!
718913705111613440 A great honor to visit the 9/11 Memorial Museum with my wife, @MELANIATRUMP, today. #NewYorkValues
718761006068051968 Bernie Sanders says that Hillary Clinton is unqualified to be president. Based on her decision making ability, I can go along with that!
718636301587771392 Isn't it a shame that the person who will have by far the most delegates and many millions more votes than anyone else, me, still must fight
718546390390071296 Donald TrumpÃ¢The Disrupter will air on @FoxNews Saturday night and Sunday night at 8 PM ET. Anchored by @BretBaier. @johnrobertsFox
718530443272970240 Nobody beats me on National Security.

718516815782088704 Jennifer is a terrific person.
718408900375154688 So great to be in New York. Catching up on many things (remember, I am still running a major business while I campaign) and loving it!
718159369033162752 Ted Cruz attacked New Yorkers and New York values- we don't forget!
717872274569822208 Unbelievable evening. Just made a speech in front 17,000 amazing New Yorkers in Bethpage, Long Island--- great to be home!
717872177782124545 I was not scheduled to be on the @oreillyfactor. Pure fiction!

716362367119069185 @FoxNews should be ashamed for allowing experts to explain how to make a nuclear attack!
716362171404435458 @HeyTammyBruce- Thank you for your nice words on Fox today. They never use my full statements on nuclear, which you would agree with!
716359318828769280 Great honor to have @GOP General Counsel, #JohnRyder as a Trump delegate in TN. RNC meeting well worth it! Unifying the party!
716344003789266944 Join me on Monday, April 4th in Milwaukee! #WIPrimary #Trump2016
716222480738869248 Wisconsin has suffered a great loss of jobs and trade, but if I win, all of the bad things happening in the U.S. will be rapidly reversed!
716088246258651136 I will be in Wisconsin until the election. Jobs, trade and immigration will be big factors. I will bring jobs back home - make great deals!
716085112610426880 If @megynkelly stopped covering me on her show, her ratings would drop like a rock! My h to h interview with @AC360 beat her by millions!
716078699175682053 Is it possible for @megynkelly to cover anyone but Donald Trump on her terrible show. She totally misrepresents my words and positions! BAD.
716031548382773248 MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
716020373045841920 Can you believe that Ted Cruz, who has been killing our country on trade for so long, just put out a Wisconsin ad talking about trade?
716019755682045952 We must build a great wall between Mexico and the United States!
715980291672829953 My new radio ad, airing today in Wisconsin! See you soon!
715973328868085761 Does anybody like Lyin' Ted?
715907894584197120 For the 1st time in American history, America's 16,500 border patrol agents have issue a presidential primary endorsementÃ¢me! Thank you.
715907761926750208 The National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) said that our open border is the biggest physical & economic threat facing the American people!
715758039836594176 The Club For Growth said in their ad that 465 delegates (Cruz) plus 143 delegates (Kasich) is more than my 739 delegates. Try again!
715756428447858688 The Club For Growth,which asked me for $1,000,000 in an extortion attempt, just put up a Wisconsin ad with incorrect math.What a dumb group!
715668280153911296 THANK YOU, NEW YORK! #Trump2016
715664091893731329 THANK YOU, AMERICA! #Trump2016

715291320563146752 Thank you- Appleton, Wisconsin!
715286909824663552 Congratulations to @CNN for having the wisdom to pick TRUMP! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
715223526635094016 Please keep your thoughts & prayers with Melissa Young- Miss Wisconsin 2005.
715216002347360256 THANK YOU, NEW YORK!
715013260462960642 @DavidGregory got thrown off of TV by NBC, fired like a dog! Now he is on @CNN being nasty to me. Not nice!
714967208439451650 Final #'s just announced in the GREAT State of MO. TRUMP WINS! New certified #'s show a 365 vote increase for me- @ least 12 more delegates!
714925079247847424 Trump defends campaign manager charged for bruising a reporter:
714899439706574848 MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
714898756420939780 Why is this reporter touching me as I leave news conference? What is in her hand??
714894618333212675 This was the reporters statement- when she found out there was tape from my facility, she changed her tune.
714891184867508224 Victory press conference was over. Why is she allowed to grab me and shout questions? Can I press charges?
714855791199719424 Why aren't people looking at this reporters earliest statement as to what happened, that is before she found out the episode was on tape?
714855025055514624 Wow, Corey Lewandowski, my campaign manager and a very decent man, was just charged with assaulting a reporter. Look at tapes-nothing there!
714825845504942080 How come the @TODAYshow & @chucktodd show the new @NBCNews Poll for Hillary vs Bernie but do not show the SAME poll where I am killing Cruz?
714818473382248448 I have millions more votes/hundreds more dels than Cruz or Kasich, and yet am not being treated properly by the Republican Party or the RNC.
714807977052610569 Wow, @CNN has nothing but my opponents on their shows. Really one-sided and unfair reporting. Maybe I shouldn't do their town-hall tonight!
714619931938197504 We need to secure our borders ASAP. No games, we must be smart, tough and vigilant. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN & MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN!
714619106151030784 Lyin' Ted, I have already beaten you in all debates, and am way ahead of you in votes and delegates. You should focus on jobs & illegal imm!
714617467839111173 Lyin'Ted Cruz is weak & losing big, so now he wants to debate again. But, according to Drudge,Time and on-line polls, I have won all debates
714591260791713792 After the way I beat Gov. Scott Walker (and Jeb, Rand, Marco and all others) in the Presidential Primaries, no way he would ever endorse me!
714581379351252996 Just released that international gangs are all over our cities. This will end when I am President!
714577392367443970 Ted Cruz is incensed that I want to refocus NATO on terrorism, as well as current mission, but also want others to PAY FAIR SHARE, a must!
714503667261562880 A detainee released from Gitmo has killed an American. When will our so-called leaders ever learn!
714463489503404032 Kirsten Powers: Anti- Trump Operative was Aggressively Shopping Cruz Story via the Gateway Pundit:
714411420104925184 I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 7:30. Things are looking good, had a great Easter-look forward to spending the week in Wisconsin!
714260201927520256 The United States cannot continue to make such bad, one-sided trade deals. There are only so many jobs we can give up. No more!
714214633016573953 See Lyin' Ted, even the @DailyBeast (no fan of mine) says this story came from Rubio, not Trump!
714198237675003904 Just to show you how unfair Republican primary politics can be, I won the State of Louisiana and get less delegates than Cruz-Lawsuit coming
714194279409848320 Why can't the pundits be honest? Hopefully we are all looking for a strong and great country again. I will make it strong and great! JOBS!
714189569793646597 Another radical Islamic attack, this time in Pakistan, targeting Christian women & children. At least 67 dead,400 injured. I alone can solve
714175472557424640 Happy Easter to all, have a great day!
714095595888238592 My statement on NATO being obsolete and disproportionately too expensive (and unfair) for the U.S. are now, finally, receiving plaudits!
714093135857631232 Wow, sleepy eyes @chucktodd is at it again. He is do totally biased. The things I am saying are correct. - far better vision than the others
714075020113240066 I am interviewed on This Week on @ABC this morning. Enjoy!
713821835402616833 Remember, I am the only candidate who is self-funding. While I am given little credit for this by the voters, I am not bought like others!
713820823665119232 Don't believe the @FoxNews Polls, they are just another phony hit job on me. I will beat Hillary Clinton easily in the General Election.
713809729764589568 Wisconsin's economy is doing poorly and like everywhere else in U.S., jobs are leaving. I will make our economy strong again - bring in jobs
713807872388440069 Nobody will protect our Nation like Donald J. Trump. Our military will be greatly strengthened and our borders will be strong. Illegals out!
713806176274804736 Lyin' Ted Cruz is now trying to convince prople that his problems with The National Enq.were caused by me. I had NOTHING to do with story!
713803130417324032 The press is going out of their way to convince people that I do not like or respect women, when they know that it is just the opposite!
713747213801938946 The media is so after me on women Wow, this is a tough business. Nobody has more respect for women than Donald Trump!
713556905550069761 Top suspect in Paris massacre, Salah Abdeslam, who also knew of the Brussels attack, is no longer talking. Weak leaders, ridiculous laws!
713133907567329285 Wow, just released that $67 million in negative ads was spent on me. How am I still number one - by a lot?
713131098969083904 I didn't start the fight with Lyin'Ted Cruz over the GQ cover pic of Melania, he did. He knew the PAC was putting it out - hence, Lyin' Ted!
713120275299229697 Just won a big federal lawsuit similar in certain ways to the Trump U case but the press refuses to write about it. If I lost-monster story!
713066424563052544 MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
713033155989610496 Endorsements for Lyin' Ted Cruz-
713031504415338497 Europe and the U.S. must immediately stop taking in people from Syria. This will be the destruction of civilization as we know it! So sad!
713030660475240448 Just announced that as many as 5000 ISIS fighters have infiltrated Europe. Also, many in U.S. I TOLD YOU SO! I alone can fix this problem!
713027407742177280 Explain how the women on The View, which is a total disaster since the great Barbara Walters left, ever got their jobs. @abc is wasting time
713025973751529472 @TheView T.V. show, which is failing so badly that it will soon be taken off thr air, is constantly asking me to go on. I TELL THEM NO
713014127061544961 Hillary Clinton has been working on solving the terrorism problem for years. TIME FOR A CHANGE, I WILL SOLVE - AND FAST!
713012045214531584 It is amazing how often I am right, only to be criticized by the media. Illegal immigration, take the oil, build the wall, Muslims, NATO!
713006944047534081 Remember when I recently said that Brussels is a hell hole and a mess and the failing @nytimes wrote a critical article. I was so right!
713006012085760001 These politicians like Cruz and Graham, who have watched ISIS and many other problems develop for years, do nothing to make things better!
713004219234709505 @LindseyGrahamSC and Lyin' Ted Cruz are two politicians who are very much alike - ALL TALK AND NO ACTION! Both talk about ISIS, do nothing!
713003045827780609 It is amazing how @LindseyGrahamSC gets on so many T.V. shows talking negatively about me when I beat him so badly (ZERO) in his pres run!
712972000927551488 We pay a disproportionate share of the cost of N.A.T.O. Why? It is time to renegotiate, and the time is now!
712969068396093440 N.A.T.O. is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on!
712782227747311616 MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
712756995330281473 I want to thank @RealSheriffJoe for all of his help in our historic Arizona win. Could not have done it without you Joe!
712748982531977216 While I believe I will clinch before Cleveland and get more than 1237 delegates, it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race!
712731263929618433 I think having Jeb's endorsement hurts Lyin' Ted. Jeb spent more than $150,000,000 and got nothing. I spent a fraction of that and am first!
712729376207540226 I will be the best by far in fighting terror. I'm the only one that was right from the beginning, & now Lyin' Ted & others are copying me.
712729040352882690 Just watched Hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror. She's been in office fighting terror for 20 years- and look where we are!
712728075532943361 Low energy Jeb Bush just endorsed a man he truly hates, Lyin' Ted Cruz. Honestly, I can't blame Jeb in that I drove him into oblivion!
712727046913462272 Lyin' Ted Cruz steals foreign policy from me, and lines from Michael DouglasÃ¢ just another dishonest politician.
712709458187694080 Thank you, Arizona! #Trump2016
712645789953167360 Lyin' Ted Cruz denied that he had anything to do with the G.Q. model photo post of Melania. That's why we call him Lyin' Ted!
712490195778727936 Hopefully the Republican Party can come together and have a big WIN in November, paving the way for many great Supreme Court Justices!
712484978735448065 Much bigger win than anticipated in Arizona. Thank you, I will never forget!
712481536470360064 Thank you, Arizona! #Trump2016
712473816614772736 Incompetent Hillary, despite the horrible attack in Brussels today, wants borders to be weak and open-and let the Muslims flow in. No way!
712457104515317764 Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad. Be careful, Lyin' Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife!
712408960918265857 Pres. Obama should leave the baseball game in Cuba immediately & get home to Washington- where a #POTUS, under a serious emergency belongs!
712357600621432832 Obama, and all others, have been so weak, and so politically correct, that terror groups are forming and getting stronger! Shame.
712357352972939265 #UtahCaucus message from @IvankaTrump! #UTCaucus

712343435387260928 My heart & prayers go out to all of the victims of the terrible #Brussels tragedy. This madness must be stopped, and I will stop it.
712311921542873088 Watch this clip from earlier this year. Time & time again I have been right about terrorism. It's time to get tough!
712300954775887876 I have proven to be far more correct about terrorism than anybody- and it's not even close. Hopefully AZ and UT will be voting for me today!
712291375958659072 MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
712291134991691777 President Obama looks and sounds so ridiculous making his speech in Cuba, especially in the shadows of Brussels. He is being treated badly!
712248639947730944 Do you all remember how beautiful and safe a place Brussels was. Not anymore, it is from a different world! U.S. must be vigilant and smart!
711653804983361536 Wow, President Obama just landed in Cuba, a big deal, and Raul Castro wasn't even there to greet him. He greeted Pope and others. No respect
711639836810203142 Big Republican Dinner tonight at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach. I will be there!
711631122036293632 So the highly overrated anchor, @megynkelly, is allowed to constantly say bad things about me on her show, but I can't fight back? Wrong!
711626493626093573 The protesters blocked a major highway yesterday, delaying entry to my RALLY in Arizona by hours, and the media blames my supporters!
711586556688146434 Why is it that the horrendous protesters, who scream, curse punch, shut down roads/doors during my RALLIES, are never blamed by media? SAD!
711521532149895168 Will be interviewed on @ThisWeekABC this morning. Enjoy!
711418254556852224 The rallies in Utah and Arizona were great! Tremendous crowds and spirit. Just returned but will be going back soon.
711388380668493824 THANK YOU ARIZONA! Get out and #VoteTrump on Tuesday! #AZPrimary
711366483872522240 Thank you- Tucson, Arizona! A great afternoon with 6,000 supporters! #VoteTrump on Tuesday!
711353589394972674 @AndreaTantaros- You are a true journalistic professional. I so agree with what you say. Keep up the great work! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
711350170798178304 @jessebwatters- Watching your show from Arizona where we just had a big rally. It is fantastic- everybody loves it!
711349494701494272 @DiamondandSilk- Just watched you on #WattersWorld with a large group of people. Everybody loves you- two amazing people! #Trump2016
711275596626665472 THANK YOU ARIZONA! 20,000 amazing supporters! Get out and #VoteTrump on Tuesday. I love you!
711218418775498752 Wow, @CNN ratings are up 75% because it's all Trump, all the time. The networks are making a fortune off of me! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
711215886909050881 Great to be back in Arizona!
711209847702749184 If crazy @megynkelly didn't cover me so much on her terrible show, her ratings would totally tank. She is so average in so many ways!
711209246419845120 Crazy @megynkelly says I don't (won't) go on her show and she still gets good ratings. But almost all of her shows are negative hits on me!
711049674782674947 Thank you- New York! I love you!
711046719421550592 Landing in Phoenix now. Tomorrow's events will be amazing! #Trump2016
711046009992798208 Reading @nytdavidbrooks of the NY Times is a total waste of time, he is a clown with no awareness of the world around him- dummy!
711042337158340608 While I have never met @nytdavidbrooks of the NY Times, I consider him one of the dumbest of all pundits- he has no sense of the real world!
711040837036154880 Heading to Phoneix. Will be arriving soon. Tomorrow a big day. Tremendous crowds expected! #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
711035814164230145 Watching @loudobbsnews- fantastic show! Has very interesting take on Paul Ryan.
711035391302889472 Just leaving Salt Lake City, Utah- fantastic crowd with no interruptions. Love Utah- will be back!
711007773052559360 Why haven't they released the final Missouri victory for us yet? Could it be because Cruz's guy runs Missouri?
710995683860484097 I guess I have reached yet another ceiling - 49.7%, with four people. My highest Reuters poll yet! Thank you!
710989203388162050 Do you believe that Hillary Clinton now wants Obamacare for illegal immigrants? She should spend more time taking care of our great Vets!
710947686879531008 Everybody should boycott the @megynkelly show. Never worth watching. Always a hit on Trump! She is sick, & the most overrated person on tv.
710929239269203968 Thank you Arizona- I love you!
710928532461883392 Join me tomorrow! #Trump2016
710928141112332288 Mitt Romney is a mixed up man who doesn't have a clue. No wonder he lost!
710924053981188096 Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney was campaigning with John Kasich & Marco Rubio, and now he is endorsing Ted Cruz. 1/2
710923287430357001 Failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney, the man who choked and let us all down, is now endorsing Lyin' Ted Cruz. This is good for me!
710920670608236544 Going to Salt Lake City, Utah, for a big rally. Lyin' Ted Cruz should not be allowed to win there - Mormons don't like LIARS! I beat Hillary
710920172106850304 Club for Growth letter- trying to extort $1,000,000.00 from me. Remember, I said- NO!
710918088460517376 Club For Growth tried to extort $1,000,000 from me. When I said NO, they went hostile with negative ads. Disgraceful!
710914741321998336 With millions of dollars of negative and phony ads against me by the establishment, my numbers continue to go up. Can anyone explain this?
710905631008546816 @EWErickson got fired like a dog from RedState and now he is the one leading opposition against me.
710904553219219456 Senator @LindseyGrahamSC made horrible statements about @SenTedCruz Ã¢ and then he endorsed him. No wonder nobody trusts politicians!
710868991309443072 Lyin' Ted Cruz lost all five races on Tuesday-and he was just given the jinx - a Lindsey Graham endorsement. Also backed Jeb. Lindsey got 0!
710857360399400960 Join us in Salt Lake City, Utah- tonight!
710626092114120708 Hillary Clinton has been involved in corruption for most of her professional life!
710563892687196160 MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
710534544865239040 Who should star in a reboot of Liar Liar- Hillary Clinton or Ted Cruz? Let me know.
710510524031746052 Highly overrated & crazy @megynkelly is always complaining about Trump and yet she devotes her shows to me. Focus on others Megyn!
710509591122075648 Looking like my 5 victories on Tuesday will be just as good as if I won Ohio. Two more days and Ohio was mine!
710507173072269314 See you in Arizona on Friday and Saturday.
710456179173040128 Please explain to the dummies at the @WSJ Editorial Board that I love to debate and have won, according to Drudge etc., all 11 of them!
710453513155960834 @WSJ is bad at math. The good news is, nobody cares what they say in their editorials anymore, especially me!
710452858043416577 @WSJ Editorial says Clinton primary vote total is 8,646,551.Trump's is 7,533,692-a knock. But she had only 3 opponents-I had 16.Apologize
710442630207901696 The reason lyin' Ted Cruz has lost so much of the evangelical vote is that they are very smart and just don't tolerate liars-a big problem!
710440524524691456 Crazy @megynkelly is now complaining that @oreillyfactor did not defend her against me - yet her bad show is a total hit piece on me.Tough!
710415602851172352 Great news that @FoxNews has cancelled the additional debate. How many times can the same people ask the same question? I beat Cruz debating
710409594204524544 Crazy @megynkelly supposedly had lyin' Ted Cruz on her show last night. Ted is desperate and his lying is getting worse. Ted can't win!
710407581899079680 Stuart Stevens, the failed campaign manager of Mitt Romney's historic loss, is now telling the Republican Party what to do with Trump. Sad!
710215733477822465 I will be interviewed on The O'Reilly Factor this evening at 8 pm on the Fox News Channel. @oreillyfactor
710214487643693058 Thank you, Missouri! #Trump2016
710177855796350977 Wow, just won Missouri!
710160479889575938 I am making a big speech the night of the @FoxNews debate, but I wish everyone well. Yesterday was a big day for me with 5 wins!
710152303966351361 Thank you to the Governor of Florida, Rick Scott, for your endorsement. I greatly appreciate your support!
710151964726792192 In the last 2 weeks, I had $35M of negative ads against me in Florida & I won in a massive landslide.The establishment should save their $$!
710149837979836416 Yesterday was amazingÃ¢5 victories. Lyin' Ted Cruz had zero. Things are going very well!
710138547827769344 Is this what we want for a President?
710097701698936835 @RepTomMarino Great job on television this morning. Glad to have you on my side!
710074677775966208 @pastormarkburns You were great last night and we all very much appreciate it! Thank you!
710073634837176320 I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:30 A.M. ENJOY!
710066971367190528 Will be interviewed on @Morning_Joe at 7:40. ENJOY!
710050536259764226 Will be interviewed on @NewDay on @CNN at 7:15 A.M.
710050169505640448 Will be interviewed on @GMA at 7:00 A.M. Big wins last night!
709941293477195776 Thank you Marco, I agree!
709930663953231873 I only wish my wonderful daughter Tiffany could have been with us at Mar-a-Lago for our great election victory. She is a winner!
709919330574725124 Thank you Illinois! #SuperTuesday
709915576173469700 Thank you, North Carolina! #Trump2016 #SuperTuesdayÃ
709894230710337536 Watching other networks and local news. Really good night! Crazy @megynkelly is unwatchable.
709893334588919808 Thank you, Florida! #SuperTuesday
709893235884335106 Thank you, Northern Mariana Islands!#SuperTuesday #Trump2016
709893207845376004 Can't watch Crazy Megyn anymore. Talks about me at 43% but never mentions that there are four people in race. With two people, big & over!
709878592189153280 Word is that, despite a record amount spent on negative and phony ads, I had a massive victory in Florida. Numbers out soon!
709819253977915392 A lot of complaints from people saying my name is not on the ballot in various places in Florida? Hope this is false.
709775232152817664 I will bring our jobs back to the U.S., and keep our companies from leaving. Nobody else can do it. Our economy will sing again.
709772129651265540 In presidential voting so far, John Kasich is ZERO for 22. So why would he be a good candidate? Hillary would beat him, I will beat Hillary!
709756933666967555 Ohio is losing jobs to Mexico, now losing Ford (and many others). Kasich is weak on illegal immigration. We need strong borders now!
709754445907759105 Watching John Kasich being interviewed - acting so innocent and like such a nice guy. Remember him in second debate, until I put him down.
709735250927226880 North Carolina lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs and Ohio lost 400,000 since 2000. Going to Mexico etc. NO MORE IF I WIN, WE WILL BRING BACK!
709720456194994176 Just in, big news- I have been declared the winner of the CNMI Rep Caucus with 72.8% of the vote! Thank you! #SuperTuesday #VoteTrump
709713295180169216 Good morning Ohio! Some additional information from my daughter, @IvankaTrump! #VoteTrump #SuperTuesday
709703632292331522 Don't reward Mitt Romney, who let us all down in the last presidential race, by voting for Kasich (who voted for NAFTA, open borders etc.).
709690378778230785 Please remember, I am the ONLY candidate who is self-funding his campaign. Kasich, Rubio and Cruz are all bought and paid for by lobbyists!
709687052384731136 I will bring our jobs back to America, fix our military and take care of our vets, end Common Core and ObamaCare, protect 2nd A, build WALL
709595310939643905 Rubio is weak on illegal immigration, with the worst voting record in the U.S. Senate in many years. He will never MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
709592458401816577 Kasich voted for NAFTA, a disaster for Ohio, and now wants the even worse TPP approved. Vote Trump and end this madness!
709547482615816192 Sadly, this kind of stuff even happened to Ronald Reagan. There is nothing nice about it! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
709541660758315009 THANK YOU - Youngstown, Ohio! I love you! Get out & #VoteTrump tomorrow. #Trump2016
709423812681531392 Kasich has helped decimate the coal and steel industries in Ohio. I will bring them back! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
709423676425379841 Gov Kasich voted for NAFTA, which devastated Ohio and is now pushing TPP hard- bad for American workers!
709422865360297984 Leaving the great people of North Carolina. Amazing event. Heading to Tampa now! #VoteTrump
709399753545670656 Look forward to being in Tampa this afternoon. Wonderful crowds. Thank you, Florida!
709362309819404289 We don't have a country- if we don't have borders. #VoteTrump
709170599579545600 Just received from @PeteRose_14. Thank you Pete! #VoteTrump on
709089928324489216 The failing @nytimes is truly one of the worst newspapers. They knowingly write lies and never even call to fact check. Really bad people!
709083187775979521 Because Gov. Kasich cannot run in the state of Pennsylvania-he cannot win the nomination- & should not be allowed to compete in Ohio on Tue.
709063220150013952 Carly Fiorina- I agree! Ted Cruz is just another politician. All talk- no action!
709063098871779328 Thank you Kevin. With unification of the party, Republican wins will be massive!
709028677497921537 Gov.Kasich of Ohio just stated on a morning show that he doesn't watch politics or anything on television, he only watches the @GolfChannel
708985532483837953 Ohio Gov.Kasich voted for NAFTA, from which Ohio has never recovered. Now he wants TPP, which will be even worse. Ohio steel and coal dying!
708983126601682944 Bernie Sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren't told to go to my events. Be careful Bernie, or my supporters will go to yours!
708857632816287744 Wow, Kasich didn't qualify to run in the state of Pennsylvania, not enough signatures. Big problem!
708800227994537984 USSS did an excellent job stopping the maniac running to the stage. He has ties to ISIS. Should be in jail!
708786643512066048 Do the people of Ohio know that John Kasich is STRONGLY in favor of Common Core! In other words, education of your children from D.C. No way
708749781519212544 Just finished my second speech. 20K in Dayton & 25K in Cleveland- perfectly behaved crowd. Thanks- I love you, Ohio!
708723421106937857 It is Clinton and Sanders people who disrupted my rally in Chicago - and then they say I must talk to my people. Phony politicians!
708720448335437824 The last person that Hillary or Bernie want to run against is Donald Trump --- and that is fact!
708715949138911232 We are asking law enforcement to check for dishonest early voting in Florida- on behalf of little Marco Rubio. No way to run a country!
708715781199044609 Word is-early voting in FL is very dishonest. Little Marco, his State Chairman, & their minions are working overtime-trying to rig the vote.
708714849027497984 The rally in Cincinnati is ON. Media put out false reports that it was cancelled!
708714838520762369 Thank you Dayton, Ohio! 20,000 supporters- largest in airport history! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
708667676768522240 MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
708667476628922369 On my way to Dayton, Ohio. Will be there soon!
708662621596213250 The rally in Cincinnati is ON. Media put out false reports that it was cancelled. Will be great - love you Ohio!
708658225198006273 Ohio had the biggest budget increase in the U.S. If it were not for striking oil, they would be bust! Governor Kasich in favor of TPP fraud!
708647560399949825 Absentee Governor Kasich voted for NAFTA and NAFTA devastated Ohio - a disaster from which it never recovered. Kasich is good for Mexico!
708619775153475584 The organized group of people, many of them thugs, who shut down our First Amendment rights in Chicago, have totally energized America!
708472737992409090 I just got off the phone with the great people of Guam! Thank you for your support! #VoteTrump today! #Trump2016
708428041232490496 Great news! Thank you Governor Ralph DLG Torres! #Trump2016
708422379366686721 It means so much to me- receiving an endorsement from Phyllis Schlafly. A truly great woman & conservative.
708403542009253889 Thank you St. Louis, Missouri!
708390521023008769 Rumor has it that @politico is going out of business. Losing too much money. Great news! Likewise, dopey Mort Zuckerman's @NYDailyNews
708332792028008448 Dr. Ben Carson- I concur. I believe in God who can change people- he can make any of us better.
708169684617535489 Thank you America! #Trump2016
708158581363888128 Thank you Mark. #GOPDebate
708045086135881728 Wow, you are all correct about @FoxNews - totally biased and disgusting reporting.
707697346646245376 Keep lightweight Marco and his friends out of the White House.
707683931609550848 Phony Club For Growth tried to shake me down for one million dollars, & is now putting out nasty negative ads on me. They are total losers!
707470040954761216 Thank you Hawaii! #Trump2016
707415229794275330 This was a great evening- I would like to thank everyone for their wonderful support.

707354724182441984 Word is I am doing very well in Michigan and Mississippi! Wow, and with all that money spent against me! Will be going to Trump Jupiter now!
707353658883706880 I hear @NBCNews / @WSJ came out with another one of their phony polls. While I am leading, they are totally discredited after last S.C. poll
707309366064578564 The negative television commercials about me, paid for by the politicians bosses, are a total #Mediafraud. When you watch, remember!
707258582501302272 Mitt Romney had his chance and blew it. Lindsey Graham ran for president, got ZERO, and quit! Why are they now spokesmen against me? Sad!
707239753352093696 Remember, I am the only one who is self-funding my campaign. All of the other candidates are bought and paid for by special interests!
707237490780934144 Sun Sentinel says: Rubio lacks the experience, work ethic and gravitas needed to be president. HE HAS NOT EARNED YOUR VOTE!
707225317648240640 MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
707208682669543425 Michigan, Mississippi, Idaho & Hawaii: Get out to VOTE and join the movement today! Video:
707037002911375360 The Club for Growth is a very dishonest group. They represent conservative values terribly & are bad for America.
707036759570382849 People forget, it was Club for Growth that asked me for $1 million. I said no & they went negative. Extortion!
707034934804873216 Ted Cruz Was For Welcoming Syrian Refugees Before He Was Against It
707029354921009152 I employ many people in Hawaii at my great hotel in Honolulu. I'll be there very soon. Vote for me, Hawaii!
707020422672474112 Cruz came to Mississippi, there was nobody there, he left the state. I had a rally in Madison, MS with 10,000!
707004752756936704 I will be interviewed by @SeanHannity tonight at 10pm EST on @FoxNews! Enjoy!
706989946268213248 New ad concerning lightweight Senator Marco Rubio:
706974796509286400 Thank you Idaho! I love your potatoes- nobody grows them better. As President, I will protect your market.
706971409818492929 Lightweight Senator Marco Rubio features Trump Univ. students in FL. attack ads- who submitted excellent reviews.
706953562316603392 It was great being in Michigan. Remember, I am the only presidential candidate who will bring jobs back to the U.S.and protect car industry!
706884676263276544 Don't believe the millions of dollars of phony television ads by lightweight Rubio and the R establishment. Dishonest people!
706862721405468672 Leaving for North Carolina. Big crowd, will be fun!
706840633508536320 Congratulation to Adam Scott and all of the folks at Trump National Doral on producing a really great WGC Tournament. Amazing finish!
706829345143316480 I will be using Facebook and Twitter to expose dishonest lightweight Senator Marco Rubio. A record no-show in Senate, he is scamming Florida
706827555622547456 We cannot let the failing REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT, who could not stop Obama (twice), ruin the MOVEMENT with millions of $'s in false ads!
706812638215303168 Lindsey Graham is all over T.V., much like failed 47% candidate Mitt Romney. These nasty, angry, jealous failures have ZERO credibility!
706808780600844288 Failed presidential candidate Lindsey Graham should respect me. I destroyed his run, brought him from 7% to 0% when he got out. Now nasty!
706675395811266560 How do you fight millions of dollars of fraudulent commercials pushing for crooked politicians? I will be using Facebook & Twitter. Watch!
706674352167772160 All of the phony T.V. commercials against me are bought and payed for by SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS, the bandits that tell your pols what to do
706544678980734976 @meetthepress and @chucktodd did a 1 hour hit job on me today Ã¢ totally biased and mostly false. Dishonest media!
706543741088067584 I am at Trump National Doral-best resort in U.S. Rory and Adam Scott are doing great! Watch on NBC at 3:00 P.M. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
706540601026744321 Thank you to @jdickerson and @FaceTheNation for a very fair and professional interview this morning. No wonder you are #1 in the ratings!
706532975782006784 Fraud lightweight Marco made a TV ad on TrumpU featuring 2 people who signed these letters:
706531628525428744 The primary plaintiff in the phony Trump University suit wants to abandon the case. Disgraceful!
706531291018170369 Nancy Reagan, the wife of a truly great President, was an amazing woman. She will be missed!
706531140195196932 David Brooks, of the New York Times, is closing in on being the dumbest of them all. He doesn't have a clue.
706530975992381441 Thank you Michigan! #Trump2016
706505531364679680 FLORIDA: Do not miss this opportunity to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! Thank you @IvankaTrump:

706179933480099840 I am watching two clown announcers on @FoxNews as they try to build up failed presidential candidate #LittleMarco. Fox News is in the bag!
706179514611724288 Romney's failed advisors, like campaign mgr Stuart Stevens are all over TV telling people how to win. But they lost- don't know how to win!
706176828843663360 @MittRomney was a disaster candidate who had no guts and choked! Romney is a total joke, and everyone knows it!
706168204259758080 Thank you, Kansas! The line going into the Orlando event is over a mile long. Massive crowd expected. Leaving Kansas now, be there soon!
706152400982179845 Getting ready to make my speech at #KansasCaucus. A great honor! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016

706150457396170753 To the people of Kentucky, Rand Paul didn't want you. Now he runs back due to his presidential failure.
706149793697902592 Why would anyone in Kentucky listen to failed presidential candidate Rand Paul re: caucus. Made a fool of himself (1%.) KY his 2nd choice!
706127055285391361 Will be in Orlando, Florida, this afternoon. 25,000 people expected. This is a movement like our GREAT COUNTRY has never seen before!
706119343289962496 Wow, big lines in Kansas.
706107571401134080 For all of today's voters please remember that I am the only candidate that is self funding my campaign, I am not bought and paid for!
706105503202410496 Great time last night in Louisiana. Big and energetic crowd. Go out and vote now, polls open. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

705565746676551680 Rubio puts out ad that my pilot was a drug dealer- not true, not my pilot! Guy owned helicopter company- don't think I ever even used.
705563410528915457 Senator Sessions will serve as the Chairman of my National Security

705397628276707328 The phony lawsuit against Trump U could have been easily settled by me but I want to go to court. 98% approval rating by students. Easy win
705362027901009921 Why did Mitt Romney BEG me for my endorsement four years ago?
705358901349388289 I am the only one who can beat Hillary Clinton. I am not a Mitt Romney, who doesn't know how to win. Hillary wants no part of Trump
705357122859614209 Why would the great people of Florida vote for a guy who, as a Senator, never even shows up to vote - worst record. Marco Rubio is a joke!
705354682886201348 I have brought millions of people into the Republican Party, while the Dems are going down. Establishment wants to kill this movement!
705352657234481152 Failed candidate Mitt Romney,who ran one of the worst races in presidential history,is working with the establishment to bury a big R win!
705234524012224512 Looks like two-time failed candidate Mitt Romney is going to be telling Republicans how to get elected. Not a good messenger!
705230846249324544 Millions of dollars being spent on false TV ads by special interest groups who own Rubio & Cruz.When you see them think of your puppet POLS
705227593205878784 Because of me, the Republican Party has taken in millions of new voters, a record. If they are not careful, they will all leave. Sad!
705179512254951424 I would love to see the Republican party and everyone get together- and unify.
705174403164860416 Just another desperate move by the man who should have easily beaten Barrack Obama. (2/2)
705174362530430976 Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney is having a news conference tomorrow to criticize me. (1/2)
705173204948656129 I am going to repeal and replace ObamaCare! Read more about my positions on healthcare reform here:
705170546003218432 @CNN poll just hit 49% for Trump. Interesting how my numbers have gone so far up since lightweight Marco Rubio has turned nasty. Love it!
705148300064907265 Why can't the leaders of the Republican Party see that I am bringing in new voters by the millions-we are creating a larger, stronger party!
705119106052308992 My wife @MELANIATRUMP will be #OnTheRecord w/ @greta tonight at 7pmE on @FoxNews. Enjoy!
705094976376541184 Marco Rubio lost big last night. I even beat him in Virginia, where he spent so much time and money. Now his bosses are desperate and angry!
705093158191951872 Why would anyone in Florida vote for lightweight Senator Marco Rubio. Check out his credit card scam, his house sale & his no show voting!
705088689295245312 The special interests and people who control our politicians (puppets) are spending $25 million on misleading and fraudulent T.V. ads on me.

704023054813433856 Little Marco Rubio treated America's ICE officers like absolute trash in order to pass Obama's amnesty.
704019808363352069 Little Marco Rubio gave amnesty to criminal aliens guilty of sex offenses. DISGRACE!
704014599708876800 Little Marco Rubio is just another Washington D.C. politician that is all talk and no action. #RobotRubio
704001490759725058 Lightweight Senator Marco Rubio is polling very poorly in Florida. The people can't stand him for missing so many votes - poor work ethic!
704000708236996608 Little Marco Rubio, the lightweight no show Senator from Florida is just another Washington politician.
704000092840325120 Mitt Romney didn't show his tax return until SEPTEMBER 21, 2012, and then only after being humiliated by Harry R! A bad messenger for estab!
703996959544250373 As I stated at the press conference on Friday regarding David Duke- I disavow.

703974892237135873 Little Marco Rubio, the lightweight no show Senator from Florida, is set to be the puppet of the special interest Koch brothers. WATCH!

703715567765737472 Incredibly proud of my son @EricTrump & his efforts on behalf of @StJude in Memphis, TN.
703711236865720320 It was an honor to be the Grand Marshall- in the Salute to Israel Parade back in 2004.
703691273455034369 Just watched lightweight Marco Rubio lying to a small crowd about my past record. He is not as smart as Cruz, and may be an even bigger liar
703628555658264576 .#RogerStone was just banned by @CNN - their loss! Tough, loyal guy.
703612722991075328 I started my business with very little and built it into a great company, with some of the best real estate assets in the World. Amazing!
703611696233852929 I only wish my wonderful father, Fred, gave me $200 million to start my business like lightweight Rubio says. He didn't - total fabrication!
703607992424345602 Fun to watch the Democrats working so hard to win the great State of South Carolina when I just won the Republican version - amazing people!
703601762876305409 I am self-funding my campaign and am therefore not controlled by the lobbyists and special interests like lightweight Rubio or Ted Cruz!
703600613897023488 Tax experts throughout the media agree that no sane person would give their tax returns during an audit. After the audit, no problem!
703598661419167744 I unfairly get audited by the I.R.S. almost every single year. I have rich friends who never get audited. I wonder why?
703567344212160512 I will be on @foxandfriends at 8:30 A.M. Will be talking about lightweight Marco Rubio and lying Ted Cruz!

703325481265815553 Thank you for your support &
703321647701307392 They don't like Rubio in Florida- he left them high & dry. Doesn't even show up for votes!
703257866820415488 Lightweight Marco Rubio was working hard last night. The problem is, he is a choker, and once a choker, always a choker! Mr. Meltdown.
703252552641478656 Wow, every poll said I won the debate last night. Great honor!
703252241487036417 Lightweight choker Marco Rubio looks like a little boy on stage. Not presidential material!
703251956198875138 Lying Ted Cruz and lightweight choker Marco Rubio teamed up last night in a last ditch effort to stop our great movement. They failed!
703250152744550400 Will be at Fort Worth (Texas) Convention Center at 11:30 A.M. Big crowd - get there early! Big announcement to be made!
703230455546404864 Why would the people of Florida vote for Marco Rubio when he defrauded them by agreeing to represent them as their Senator and then quit!
703218582310641667 Have a good chance to win Texas on Tuesday. Cruz is a nasty guy, not one Senate endorsement and, despite talk, gets nothing done. Loser!
703217073724399616 I will be making a speech at 12:00 in Fort Worth, Texas. Really big crowd expected. Will be talking about the debate last night-plus, plus!
703111149764489216 Big day in Texas tomorrow! Having a rally in Fort Worth. Tremendous crowd. Will be exciting! #Trump2016

703092155577831424 Failed presidential candidate @MittRomney was made to look like a fool by Senator Harry Reid & didn't release his tax returns until 9/21/12.
702953023736250369 FMR PRES of Mexico, Vicente Fox horribly used the F word when discussing the wall. He must apologize! If I did that there would be a uproar!
702930575083106304 Early on Ted Cruz said that if he didn't win South Carolina, it's over. He didn't win- and lost to me in a landslide!

702896239520645121 LETS MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
702894623761498112 Signing a recent tax return- isn't this ridiculous?
702891487776866306 Just for your info, tax returns have 0 to do w/ someone's net worth. I have already filed my financial statements w/ FEC. They are great!
702887030892658688 Why doesn't @MittRomney just endorse @marcorubio already. Should have done it before NH or Nevada where he had a little sway. Too late
702833969537142788 Mitt Romney, who was one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics, is now pushing me on tax returns. Dope!
702706412980453380 Great new poll. Thank you Texas! #VoteTrump #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
702679486496706564 Ted Cruz is lying again. Polls are showing that I do beat Hillary Clinton head to head. Check out Poll snd Q Poll.

702641468398292994 When Ted Cruz quits the race and the field begins to clear, I will get most of his votes - no problem!
702640425623003136 Why would Texans vote for liar Ted Cruz when he was born in Canada, lived there for 4 years-and remained a Canadian citizen until recently
702635699594469377 When Mitt Romney asked me for my endorsement last time around, he was so awkward and goofy that we all should have known he could not win!
702632410341576704 Mitt Romney,who totally blew an election that should have been won and whose tax returns made him look like a fool, is now playing tough guy
702608081314816000 The polls show that I picked up many Jeb Bush supporters. That is how I got to 46%. When others drop out, I will pick up more. Sad but true
702561529447763968 MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

702178985430503424 Unlike the other Republican candidates, I will be in Nevada all day and night - I won't be fleeing, in and out. I love & invest in Nevada!

702157754283130884 I am growing the Republican Party tremendously - just look at the numbers, way up! Democrats numbers are significantly down from years past.
702149896325890048 Ted Cruz lifts the Bible high into the air and then lies like a dog-over and over again! The Evangelicals in S.C. figured him out & said no!
702147760926011393 Ted Cruz does not have the right temperment to be President. Look at the way he totally panicked in firing his director of comm. BAD!
702141081027104769 Wow was Ted Cruz disloyal to his very capable director of communication. He used him as a scape goat-fired like a dog! Ted panicked.
702140146343280640 Ted Cruz only talks tough on immigration now because he did so badly in S.C. He is in favor of amnesty and weak on illegal immigration.
701999802033111040 THANK YOU LAS VEGAS, NEVADA!

701957484328583168 Ted Cruz said on @oreillyfactor that illegals sent out of country by my administration would come right back as citizens. Another lie-crazy!
701956476571512832 A big fat hit job on @oreillyfactor tonight. A total waste of time to watch, boring and biased. @brithume said I would never run, a dope!

701876939095543808 Ted Cruz should be disqualified from his fraudulent win in Iowa. Weak RNC and Republican leadership probably won't let this happen! Sad.
701875717504536576 Just saw the phony ad by Cruz - totally false, more dirty tricks. He got caught in so many lies - is this man crazy?
701872910764343296 Ted Cruz has now apologized to Marco Rubio and Ben Carson for fraud and dirty tricks. No wonder he has lost Evangelical support!
701871659150548993 Ted Cruz has been playing an ad about me that is so ridiculously false - no basis in fact. Take ad down Ted. Biggest liar in politics!
701870081827966976 Wow, Ted Cruz falsely suggested Marco Rubio mocked the Bible and was just forced to fire his Communications Director. More dirty tricks!
701868541545295872 It is so important to audit The Federal Reserve, and yet Ted Cruz missed the vote on the bill that would allow this to be done.
701842514760724480 Thank you for your endorsement @paulteutulsr! #BikersForTrump #VoteTrumpNV Video:
701801713385115648 Many people are now saying I won South Carolina because of the last debate. I showed anger and the people of our country are very angry!

701762526158061568 The reason that Ted Cruz lost the Evangelicals in S.C. is because he is a world class LIAR, and Evangelicals do not like liars!
701750410621497345 I am in Las Vegas, at the best hotel (by far), Trump International. I will be working with my wonderful teams and volunteers to WIN Nevada!
701743902093504512 A number of months ago, I was not expected to win South Carolina,Ted Cruz was, and yet I won in a landslide - every group and category. WIN!

701437415047700482 Thank you South Carolina!
701435508283588608 A quote was read from a parody account last night on MSNBC re: Jeb.
701374019644366848 The failing @WSJ Wall Street Journal should fire both its pollster and its Editorial Board. Seldom has a paper been so wrong.Totally biased!

701196121759068160 People (pundits) gave me no chance in South Carolina. Now it looks like a possible win. I would be happy with a one vote victory! (HOPE)
701098843635580928 South Carolina voters have the future of our country in their hands. Vote now (today), and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
701089616825159680 Remember that Marco Rubio is very weak on illegal immigration. South Carolina needs strength as illegals and Syrians pour in. Don't allow it
701084443889381377 I wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque? Very sad that he did not go!
701066624800059393 I am the only candidate (in many years) who is self-funding his campaign. Lobbyists and $ interests totally control all other candidates!

700795170023825408 I use both iPhone & Samsung. If Apple doesn't give info to authorities on the terrorists I'll only be using Samsung until they give info.
700787183872057344 I have built so many great & complicated projectsÃ¢ creating tens of thousands of jobs-video:
700779489907892225 Remember, Cruz and Bush gave us Roberts who upheld #ObamaCare twice! I am the only one who will #MAKEAMERICAGREATAGAIN!
700779318260195330 I'm self-funding and I am going to take care of the people Ã¢ not the special interests and insurance companies like the other candidates.
700779226715316224 I will replace it with private plans, health savings accounts, & allow purchasing across state lines. Maximum choice & freedom for consumer.
700779139985440769 I was referring to a backstop for pre-existing conditions. I will eliminate the law, in its entirety, & replace it w/ something much better.
700779018405150722 I was asked about healthcare by Anderson Cooper & have been consistent- I will repeal all of #ObamaCare, including the mandate, period.
700755931420823553 A message from @IvankaTrump! #SCPrimary #VoteTrumpSC #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

700381146392195074 Response to the Pope:
700321698780991488 I agree with Marco Rubio that Ted Cruz is a liar!
700320270620454912 @FoxNews is changing their theme from fair and balanced to unfair and unbalanced. But dying @WSJ is worse.Their phony poll is a joke!
700311461734850560 Thank you South Carolina! Together, WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! #VoteTrumpSC
700306531720499201 Thank you America! #Trump2016
700295391842058240 New CBS National Poll just out - massive lead for Trump. The Wall Street Journal/NBC Poll is a total joke. No wonder WSJ is doing so badly!
700280013107523584 I love being in South Carolina. We are leading big in all of the State polls - Saturday is a BIG day. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
700271935276634113 The just out USA Today National Poll, where I lead by big numbers, shows that in a head to head matchup, I beat both Hillary and Bernie.
700269643789955074 Amazing that while I lead by big numbers in the new Q and and USA Today polls, the the press only wants to report on the phony WSJ/NBC poll.
700096775454138368 Join us tomorrow in Kiawah, South Carolina! #SCPrimary #VoteTrumpSC
699994606264586242 Thank you Nevada! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
699989532180135936 Jeb Bush just got contact lenses and got rid of the glasses. He wants to look cool, but it's far too late. 1% in Nevada!
699989306333650944 Just out Nevada poll shows Jeb Bush at 1%, he should take his dumb mouthpiece, @LindseyGrahamSC, and just go home.
699968804311470080 @FoxNews is so biased it is disgusting. They do not want Trump to win. All negative!
699966633918525441 I will beat Hillary easily, but Lindsey Graham says I won't, and yet he got zero against me- no cred! Why does FOX put him on?
699966498819940353 @lindseygraham, who had zero in his presidential run before dropping out in disgrace- saying the most horrible things about me on @FoxNews.
699913243251339265 Interesting how President Obama so haltingly said I would never be president - This from perhaps the worst president in U.S. history!
699805136038846464 Why does @megynkelly devote so much time on her shows to me, almost always negative? Without me her ratings would tank. Get a life Megyn!
699801607177945088 Thank you @kayleighmcenany for your nice words - great knowledge and style! We are doing really well in South Carolina. @CNN @donlemon
699793608963198978 @brithume thinks that when Republicans drop out of the race, someone will pick up ALL of that vote. The fact is I will get much of it!
699791469532594177 Explain to @brithume and @megynkelly, who know nothing, that I will beat Hillary and win states (and dem-indie votes) that no other R can!
699733970158800898 Will be interviewed by @StephenAtHome tonight by phone- a late show first @CBS @colbertlateshow. Enjoy!
699728584575946754 Thank you, South Carolina! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
699702258792034304 Thank you to the 2,500+ in North Augusta, South Carolina. Lines down the block! Don't forget to VOTE on Saturday!
699659811420553217 #TeamTrump is thinking of Captain Andrew Maitner. A true American hero. #MaitnerStrong
699654401481449472 Just sat down for a great interview with @PHussionWYFF in Greenville today. Watch at 5pm. An amazing day in South Carolina! #VoteTrumpSC
699554325622886400 New PPP Poll just out - Trump up big, Cruz, Rubio and Bush down. The debate results, even with a stacked RNC audience, were wonderful!
699546805143523328 Spent the full day at meetings and a major rally yesterday in South Carolina. Great people and spirit. Today will be more of the same.
699447731606130688 New South Carolina poll from PPP. Thank you! #VoteTrumpSC
699441442041815040 What a night! 10,000 amazing supporters in Greenville, South Carolina! THANK YOU! VOTE on Saturday! #VoteTrumpSC
699341413448871936 Thank you for your continued support!
699328126631870465 RESPONSE TO THE LIES OF SENATOR CRUZ:
699284455282884612 JEB is a hypocrite! Used massive private Eminent Domain --- Just another clueless politician!
699283248506105856 Jeb used Eminent Domain & took advantage of a disabled vet in the process. (2/2)
699283203027292161 I'd like to call JEB a liar, but the truth is he has no clue & never revealed that he used Eminent Domain- when criticizing me! (1/2)
699232824990285824 Now that George Bush is campaigning for Jeb(!), is he fair game for questions about World Trade Center, Iraq War and eco collapse? Careful!
699230466130513921 I will be in South Carolina all week. Saturday is BIG, BIG, BIG! Get out and vote - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
699207531118383105 Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz are not electable presidential candidates, Hillary would destroy them. Ted may not be eligible to run - born in Canada
699187712553807872 Funny that Jeb(!) didn't want help from his family in his failed campaign and didn't even want to use his last name.Then mommy, now brother!
698990680719360000 Ted Cruz, along with Jeb Bush, pushed Justice John Roberts onto the Supreme Court. Roberts could have killed ObamaCare twice, but didn't!
698977598844637185 Wow, in the new CBS Poll I went way up into the forties! Thank you!
698976776115130369 Tickets for future debates should be put out to the general public instead of being given to the lobbyists & special interests - the bosses!
698973988891009024 Loved the debate last night, and almost everyone said I won, but the RNC did a terrible job of ticket distrbution. All donors & special ints
698921597466472448 Thank you for your support! TOGETHER we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
698882145297764353 I will be on Face the Nation with John Dickerson on CBS this morning. Enjoy!
698882048069652480 This shows what a complete & total liar Ted Cruz is- he said he wouldn't have nominated John Roberts. Really?
698853277706784772 Even though every poll, Time, Drudge etc., has me winning the debate by a lot, @FoxNews only puts negative people on. Biased - a total joke!
698755140602499073 Hey @glennbeck- see how I beat your boy Ted- in your own Blaze poll? Your endorsement means nothing! #GOPDebate
698751641873444864 All polls have me winning debate big- Drudge, TIME, etc. Dopey Charles Krauthammer still nasty. He has zero cred- totally dishonest!
698742963447451648 How can @JebBush beat Hillary Clinton- if he can't beat anyone else on the #GOPDebate stage with $150M? I am the only one who can!
698740358688194560 Thank you! I miss my father.
698739578002403328 Lightweight @JebBush said tonight he didn't know his family used private eminent domain in Texas- Lie!
698677500491075585 On the way to the #GOPDebate with my wonderful wife @MelaniaTrump.
698661220258357248 Ted Cruz is a cheater! He holds the Bible high and then lies and misrepresents the facts!
698660826463539201 Nasty Ted Cruz is at it again- same dirty tricks he used w/ @RealBenCarson- saying I may not be on ballot & I hold liberal positions. LIES!
698658112031604736 Wow! Honored to be chosen by the highly respected + accurate Washington & Lee Mock Convention. I hope you are right - I will make you proud!
698636369229385728 The totally unexpected loss of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is a massive setback for the Conservative movement and our COUNTRY!
698634582120333314 Love the people of South Carolina - look very much forward to the debate tonight.
698557683838947329 Thank you, South Carolina! We will MAKE AMERICA SAFE & GREAT AGAIN!
698557567254056960 Get on Trump's List email from the RNC was not authorized. I am self funding my campaign! Do not pay.
698548066643800064 A very big thank you to Bill Donohue, head of The Catholic League, for the wonderful interview on @CNN and article in Newsmax! Great insight
698546735652716545 Totally unauthorized, do not pay. I am self funding my campaign! Notice has just been withdrawn. #Trump2016
698546455309611009 The RNC, which is probably not on my side, just illegally put out a fundraising notice saying Trump wants you to contribute to the RNC.
698526221525610496 Now an additional 600-700 jobs in America (2,000) being eliminated for move to Mexico- via Hartford Courant.
698522430847983616 I am the only one who can fix this. Very sad. Will not happen under my watch! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
698370366369038336 Just got back from Tampa. It was an amazing evening with an even more amazing crowd - fantastic people! Will be in South Carolina tomorrow.
698338315205013504 Word is that little Morty Zuckerman's @NYDailyNews loses more than $50 million per year---can that be possible?
698336821349117952 When little Morty Zuckerman closes his failing @NYDailyNews will I at least be given some credit? Will happen soon.
698334356079833088 11,000 inside venue tonight in Tampa! Broke record set by Elton John in 1988 w/out musical instruments! Another 5,000 outside. Will be back!
698303565232623616 I will end illegal immigration and protect our borders! We need to MAKE AMERICA SAFE & GREAT AGAIN! #Trump2016
698263859753316352 Millions of $'s of false ads, paid for by lobbyists-special interests of cheater @SenTedCruz and sleepy @JebBush, are now running in S.C.
698242702194954240 Last time lightweight @JebBush tried to knock off @marcorubio he made a total fool of himself. If he doesn't do better this time, he is out!
698231571594276866 If @TedCruz doesn't clean up his act, stop cheating, & doing negative ads, I have standing to sue him for not being a natural born citizen.
698219929762398209 Lightweight @JebBush is spending a fortune of special interest against me in SC. False advertising- desperate and sad!
698210543467896832 After hearing the news that they would not be able to extort $1M from me, they went hostile w/ a series of incorrect & ill-informed ads.
698210486437937153 Nothing conservative about the Club for Growth coming into my office and demanding a $1M contribution, which naturally, they did not get.
698205519383646208 You must be registered Republican by February 16th to vote TRUMP in the Florida primary.
698179564107886592 The failing @NYDailyNews, destroyed by little Morty Zuckerman, is preparing to close and save face by going online. It's dead!
698156678496305152 NEVADA! Tomorrow is the deadline to register Republican.
698115252844634112 How can Ted Cruz be an Evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest?
697998702477242369 Lying Cruz put out a statement, Trump & Rubio are w/Obama on gay marriage. Cruz is the worst liar, crazy or very dishonest. Perhaps all 3?
697996266345795585 Weak JEB getting thrown out by management during speech. Do you think he will be this tough on Putin & others?
697985595554066437 THANK YOU- Baton Rouge, Louisiana! WE will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! #Trump2016
697949869961568256 Just landed in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Reports are out that lines are three quarters of a mile to get in. Wow! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
697944232997294080 Cruz caught cold in lie after denial of push polls like lies w/ @RealBenCarson. How can he preach Christian values?
697919015688278016 Heading to Baton Rouge, Louisiana for a speech. Expecting a very large crowd! See you soon. #Trump2016
697882687923752961 We are getting reports from many voters that the Cruz people are back to doing very sleazy and dishonest pushpolls on me. We are watching!
697869206893756416 Jeb failed as Jeb! He gave up and enlisted Mommy and his brother (who got us into the quicksand of Iraq). Spent $120 million.Weak-no chance!
697825190282182656 He (or she) who hesitates is lost: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
697815901190619136 Remember, it was the Republican Party, with the help of Conservatives, that made so many promises to their base, BUT DIDN'T KEEP THEM! Hi DT
697807321167224832 @MarkHalperin showed a focus group on @Morning_Joe me using a very bad word. I never said the word, left an open blank. Please apologize!
697800242553581570 Jeb Bush spent more than $40,000,000 in New Hampshire to come in 4 or 5, I spent $3,000,000 to come in 1st. Big difference in capability!
697785447771172864 There are no buyers for the worthless @NYDailyNews but little Mort Zuckerman is frantically looking. It is bleeding red ink - a total loser!
697613947655086080 I have been consistent in my opposition to Common Core. Get rid of Common Core--- keep education local!
697604044269953025 THANK YOU- Clemson, South Carolina! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #SCPrimary
697594507777482752 I was referring to the fact that Jeb Bush wants to keep common core.
697568064611561472 Big speech tonight in South Carolina - 7:00 P.M. Tremendous crowd!
697440600535203842 So funny, Jeb Bush called me a highly gifted politician and a great entertainer - I assume that is a compliment!
697414064763510784 Such a great experience in New Hampshire - amazing people! Will be leaving for a big event in South Carolina today.
697404736211959808 Like the worthless @NYDailyNews, looks like @politico will be going out of business. Bad reporting- no money, no cred!
697404578019598336 Worthless @NYDailyNews, which dopey Mort Zuckerman, is desperately trying to sell, has no buyer! Liabilities are massive!
697404309814800385 Dopey Mort Zuckerman, owner of the worthless @NYDailyNews, has a major inferiority complex. Paper will close soon!
697263333959995393 Thank you to the people of New Hampshire, I love you! Now, off to South Carolina.
697263254083489792 Thank you, New Hampshire! Departing with my amazing family now! #FITN #NHPrimary
697183070357753862 We will stop heroin and other drugs from coming into New Hampshire from our open southern border. We will build a WALL and have security.
697182075045179392 We will immediately repeal and replace ObamaCare - and nobody can do that like me. We will save $'s and have much better healthcare!
697173206663213057 ISIS is making big threats today - no respect for U.S.A. or our leader - If I win it will be a very different story,with very fast results
697099208415903744 New Hampshire vote today - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
697077741640880129 You can find your polling locations at:
697065472425123840 A message to the great people of New Hampshire on this important day! #VoteTrumpNH

697051619427397633 MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
697050425195941888 I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:40. A.M. Enjoy!
697033106608541697 The polls are now showing that I am the best to win the GENERAL ELECTION. States that are never in play for Repubs will be won by me. Great!
697031343272812544 No-one has done more for people with disabilities than me. I have spent many millions of dollars to help out-and am happy to have done so!
697029254584934400 I know the Governors and Jeb Bush, who has gone nasty with lies, is by far the weakest of the lot. His family used private eminent domain!
697027290820186112 Remember @JebBush wants COMMON CORE (education from D.C.) and is very weak on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION (come as act of love). Not a leader!
696908121327980545 Thank you, New Hampshire! #FITN
696881322858573826 Thank you, New Hampshire!
696782375863394304 Now that Bush has wasted $120 million of special interest money on his failed campaign, he says he would end super PACs. Sad!
696781378596302848 Today's third stop- Londonderry, New Hampshire! Thank you!
696763168178204672 America needs strong leadership. Politicians can talk but they don't get things done. Video:
696734735578615808 Everybody is laughing at Jeb Bush-spent $100 million and is at bottom of pack. A pathetic figure!
696733541313474566 Jeb Bush is desperate - strongly in favor of #CommonCore and very weak on illegal immigration.
696732694135312386 Thank you for your support at this mornings Town Hall- in Salem, New Hampshire. #FITN #NHPrimary
696669855416766467 Jeb Bush has zero communication skills so he spent a fortune of special interest money on a Super Bowl ad. He is a weak candidate!
696665030549487616 My two wonderful sons, Don and Eric, will be on @foxandfriends at 7:02 - now! Enjoy.
696514666843996160 So far the Super Bowl is very boring - not nearly as exciting as politics - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
696463477104365568 I am in New Hampshire having a great time! Loved the #GOPDebate last night! Everybody enjoy the Super Bowl. #SuperBowlSunday #SB50
696447301783592961 Thank you- Plymouth, New Hampshire! #FITN #NHPrimary

696025012424306690 Join me tomorrow in Plymouth, New Hampshire! #FITN #NHPrimary
695989902031331333 The New Hampshire drug epidemic must stop. If elected POTUS- I will create borders & the drugs will stop pouring in.
695979656617578496 Wow, Jeb Bush, whose campaign is a total disaster, had to bring in mommy to take a slap at me. Not nice!
695809280587534336 Border agent: We might as well abolish our immigration laws altogether
695806716601040896 I said this was happening long ago- I will stop this immediately!
695799815939190784 I told you so. Our country totally lost control of illegal immigration, even with criminals.
695791084413317124 10,000 people in South Carolina, unbelievable evening! Will be in New Hampshire tomorrow- love it.
695789403374014464 Really dumb @CheriJacobus. Begged my people for a job. Turned her down twice and she went hostile. Major loser, zero credibility!
695742029083574274 Join me at Clemson University on Wednesday, February 10th! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
695716589388308480 Heading to South Carolina, really big crowd! Will be back in New Hampshire tomorrow.
695707547395891202 Such great support in New Hampshire. So many people are working so hard to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!
695705786903830528 I very much look forward to tomorrow's debate in New HampshireÃ¢so many things to say, so much at stake. It will be an incredible evening!
695664927483240448 Live Free or Die: A motto for the whole country to follow. #NewHampshire #FITN #VoteTrumpNH
695650797615521792 Big storm in New Hampshire. Moved my event to Monday. Will be there next four days.

695373506976976901 I will be interviewed by Anderson Cooper at 8pm on @CNN from New Hampshire. Should be very interesting!
695278741048684544 Taking a helicopter to New Hampshire, boarding now. Amazing activity planned. New UMASS poll, very nice!
695252170535477249 Politicians are trying to chip away at the 2nd Amendment. I won't let them take away our guns! #Trump2016
695134210273775617 This is the Cruz voter violation certificate sent to everyone, a misdemeanor at minimum.
695133873139752960 @oreillyfactor @KarlRove- as per the show, an even more serious Cruz charge is the fraudulent voter violation certificate sent to everyone.
695133644562628608 #ICYMI: @KarlRove & @oreillyfactor discuss what Ted Cruz did to the great people of Iowa- as they went to vote.
695133044940759040 Thank you @billoreilly & @KarlRove. Ted Cruz should be immediately disqualified in Iowa, with each candidate moving up one notch.
695082204100071424 Sanders says he wants to run against me because he doesn't want to run against me. He would be so easy to beat!
695072233610280960 THANK YOU to everyone in Little Rock, Arkansas tonight! A record crowd of 12K. #Trump2016
694996040349540354 Stop the assault on American values. Stand w/ Trump to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!
694984862122561536 Thank you New Hampshire! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #FITN
694984821093830656 Dr. Ben Carson blasted Ted Cruz for deceit and dirty tricks and lies.
694979360441384960 Cruz just lied again- I am, and have been totally against #ObamaCare- repeal and replace!
694964856609439745 The State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated- a total fraud!
694963798273323008 This was sent out from Ted Cruz- as Iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote. #CruzFraud
694960957928431617 I will be interviewed on @greta at 7:00 P.M. Enjoy! @FoxNews
694890328273346560 Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.
694888332099239936 And finally, Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and choice - a total lie!
694885775431835648 The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud
694884902618165248 Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also, Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters.
694882228665507840 During primetime of the Iowa Caucus, Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz.
694879900256354304 Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!
694750254378422272 Great job on @donlemon tonight @kayleighmcenany @cherijacobus begged us for a job. We said no and she went hostile. A real dummy! @CNN
694647454365552640 On my way to New Hampshire- expecting a big and spirited crowd!
694611948940443648 Anybody who watched all of Ted Cruz's far too long, rambling, overly flamboyant speech last nite would say that was his Howard Dean moment!
694600151894212608 @Morning_Joe @mikebarnicle on @realDonaldTrump: He finished 2nd but he made the turn successfully like a pro
694560681090248704 I don't believe I have been given any credit by the voters for self-funding my campaign, the only one. I will keep doing, but not worth it!
694559410488737793 I will be talking about my wonderful experience in Iowa and the simultaneous unfair treatment by the media-later in New Hampshire. Big crowd
694558166697271297 The media has not covered my long-shot great finish in Iowa fairly. Brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history!
694554471154749440 Because I was told I could not do well in Iowa, I spent very little there - a fraction of Cruz & Rubio. Came in a strong second. Great honor
694551687080644612 My experience in Iowa was a great one. I started out with all of the experts saying I couldn't do well there and ended up in 2nd place. Nice
694149534918651905 It all begins today - WE WILL FINALLY TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK AND MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
693902396485799936 @DonaldJTrumpJr & his wife @MrsVanessaTrump attended the #SnowflakeGardenBrunch- here w/ Governor @TerryBranstad.
693866510578651138 Watch @IvankaTrump show you how easy it is to #CaucusForTrump in Iowa! #IACaucus Video:
693838082282430464 So nice to get an endorsement from the founder and owner of Pizza Ranch in Iowa! A great guy and great places! #CaucusForTrump
693832776844378113 It is time to take back our country- and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
693807728611893249 I will be interviewed on Face The Nation with @jdickerson this morning. Enjoy!
693806945505976321 I am in Iowa. Will be interviewed on This Week With @GStephanopoulos this morning. ENJOY!
693806043407618048 If I would have done the last debate, a record would have been set (instead of the poor ratings recieved). Also, VETS got $6,000,000.
693803936965197824 By not doing the failed, poorly rated debate, I was able to make the point of not allowing unfairness - while raising $6,000,000 for VETS.
693801552855740416 Wow, just saw an ad - Cruz is lying on so many levels. There is nobody more against ObamaCare than me, will repeal & replace. He lies!
693784955537592320 Ted Cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important Financial Disclosure Form. Very low interest loans, scam!
693782388564865024 Ted Cruz is totally unelectable, if he even gets to run (born in Canada). Will loose big to Hillary. Polls show I beat Hillary easily! WIN!
693778147439824896 I will be going to church in Iowa this morning with my wife, Melania. After church I will be making two speeches and touring the State!
693776360750190592 @bobvanderplaats is a total phony and con man. When I wouldn't give him free hotel rooms and much more, he endorsed Cruz. @foxandfriends
693774895591763968 @bobvanderplaats asked me to do an event. The people holding the event called me to say he wanted $100,000 for himself.Phony @foxandfriends
693773484984434688 @bobvanderplaats is a total phony and dishonest guy. Asked me for expensive hotel rooms, free (and more). I said pay and he endorsed Cruz!
693771408896229378 The Cruz campaign issued a dishonest and deceptive get out the vote ad calling voters in violation. They are now under investigation. Bad!
693471204469035008 MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
693434873600720897 I want to thank evangelical Christians for the warm embrace I've received on the campaign trail. Video:
693413034044297216 I will be in Iowa all day and until Tuesday morning. Finally, after all these years of watching stupidity, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
693280682534137856 Hillary Clinton is a major national security risk. Not presidential material!
693263187702059008 THANK YOU to all of the incredible volunteers, behind the scenes in Iowa! #CaucusForTrump
693250845333389312 Looking forward to a great weekend in Iowa! #IACaucus #CaucusForTrump
693247721453543424 @oreillyfactor The people of Iowa love the fact that I stuck up for my rights, as I will do for the U.S. Also got $6,000,000 for our VETS!
693245205617758208 @FoxNews is the only network that does not even mention my very successful event last night. $6,000,000 raised in one hour for our VETS.
693243553271713792 Amazing that Ted Cruz can't even get a Senator like @BenSasse, who is easy, to endorse him. Not one Senator is endorsing Canada Ted!
693241143744696320 @BenSasse looks more like a gym rat than a U.S. Senator. How the hell did he ever get elected? @greta
693239943519453184 The great State of Nebraska can do much better than @BenSasse as your Senator. Saw him on @greta - totally ineffective. Wants paid for pols.
693219967215493121 The new e-mail release is a disaster for Hillary Clinton. At a minimum, how can someone with such bad judgement be our next president?
693183469967560704 Thank you for all of your support Iowa!
693171827363991553 They say that if I participated in last night's Fox debate, they would have had 12 million more & would have broken the all time record.
693144862208757761 Thank you, America! #Trump2016
693139866297700352 Join me tomorrow in Dubuque, Iowa! #IACaucus #Trump2016

692918726795104256 An unbelievable night in Iowa with our great Veterans! We raised $6,000,000.00 while the politicians talked! #GOPDebate
692864417101287425 Watching biased Charles @krauthammer, a @FoxNews flunky who didn't know that I won every debate, in particular- the last one. Check polls!

692698645863518208 The debate tonight will be a total disaster - low ratings with advertisers and advertising rates dropping like a rock. I hate to see this.
692677570282786816 Wow, two candidates called last night and said they want to go to my event tonight at Drake University.
692553019150503937 On Greta, 87% of the people said they would not watch the debate if I'm not in it. Wow- what an honor!
692551355920158722 FOX debate advertising rates falling like a rock! Tune into my special event for the Veterans at 9pm EST!
692542762445594624 Thank you- Lexington, South Carolina!
692479630931001349 It was the childishly written & taunting PR statement by Fox that made me not do the debate, more so than lightweight reporter, @megynkelly.
692467143896604677 I will be interviewed on @oreillyfactor tonight at 8:00 P.M. (Eastern). Enjoy!
692457315941900288 I am self funding my campaign so I do not owe anything to lobbyists & special interests.
692430362966921217 Even though I beat him in the first six debates, especially the last one, Ted Cruz wants to debate me again. Can we do it in Canada?
692422072967020544 Just got to listen to Rush Limbaugh - the guy is fantastic!
692331943132794882 The statement put out yesterday by @FoxNews was a disgrace to good broadcasting and journalism. Who would ever say something so nasty & dumb
692312112115380224 I refuse to call Megyn Kelly a bimbo, because that would not be politically correct. Instead I will only call her a lightweight reporter!
692205512130215938 CBS's FACE THE NATION - Posts Largest Audience Since 2001

692045676079874048 Should I do the #GOPdebate?
692045112872820736 @bobvanderplaats begged me to do an event while asking organizers for $100,000 for himselfÃ¢a bad guy!
692028126189199360 Great honor- Rev. Jerry Falwell Jr. of Liberty University, one of the most respected religious leaders in our nation, has just endorsed me!

691743513483026432 Cruz lies are almost as bad as Jeb's. These politicians will do anything to stay at the trough!
691743052529012736 Cruz going down fast in recent polls- dropping like a rock. Lies never work!
691742501212983296 Ted Cruz is a nervous wreck. He is making reckless charges not caring for the truth! His poll #'s are way down!

691613075984752640 It's time for Ted Cruz to either settle his problem with the FACT that he was born in Canada and was a citizen of Canada, or get out of race

691072793853632512 Love making correct predictions. National Review is over.
691068215342952448 Word is that crying @GlennBeck left the GOP and doesn't have the right to vote in the Republican primary. Dumb as a rock.
691068100830040064 Serious doubt in Illinois as to whether or not Cruz can run for President. First of many challenges.
691041847905390592 Just left a great event in Pella. Going to church tomorrow in Muscatine, Iowa.

690990909719052288 Just left Sioux Center, Iowa. My speech was very well received. Truly great people! Packed house- overflow!
690947906308681729 A wonderful story on Iowa voters by @arappeport of the @NYTimes.
690940712578195457 Failing @GlennBeck lost all credibility. Not only was he fired @ FOX, he would have voted for Clinton over McCain.
690940125014917120 Based on @MegynKelly's conflict of interest and bias she should not be allowed to be a moderator of the next debate.
690939641617211393 Heading to Sioux County, Iowa, where the crowd is amazing. Dr. Robert Jeffress will make the introduction. Make America Great Again!
690913646117974016 Ted Cruz poll numbers are down big. Because he was born in Canada and was, until recently, a Canadian citizen, many believe he cannot run!
690912264094781440 I am in Iowa watching all of these phony T.V. ads by the other candidates. All bull, politicians are all talk and no action-it won't happen!
690908222249512960 @AnnCoulter has been amazing. We will win and establish strong borders, we will build a WALL and Mexico will pay. We will be great again!
690896236765806592 I will be the greatest job-producing president in American history. #Trump2016 #VoteTrump
690889105035538434 I am in Iowa. Will be making two speeches today. Good luck to all of the great folks on the East coast. Enjoy the beauty of the storm!
690732776920743937 A wonderful article by a writer who truly gets it. I am for the people and the people are for me. #Trump2016
690717760205275136 Is Cruz honest? He is in bed w/ Wall St. & is funded by Goldman Sachs/Citi, low interest loans. No legal disclosure & never sold off assets.
690716679496679424 Cruz did not renounce his Canadian citizenship as a US Senator- only when he started to run for #POTUS. He could be Canadian Prime Minister.
690709138884661248 Cruz says I supported TARP, which gave $25 million to Goldman Sachs, the bank which loaned him the money he didn't disclose. Puppet!
690708850664669185 The only reason irrelevant @GlennBeck doesn't like me is I refused to do his failing show - asked many times. Very few listeners - sad!
690708660377513984 @BrentBozell, one of the National Review lightweights, came to my office begging for money like a dog. Why doesn't he say that?
690701138899898368 Just watched Jeb's ad where he desperately needed mommy to help him. Jeb --- mom can't help you with ISIS, the Chinese or with Putin.
690684930259423232 Ted Cruz went down big in just released Reuters poll - what's going on? Is it Goldman Sachs/Citi loans or Canada?
690682782163447808 Rush Limbaugh is great, tells it as he sees it---really honorable guy! Thanks Rush! #Trump2016
690682449387397120 The tax scam Washington Post does among the most inaccurate stories of all. Really dishonest reporting.
690680515800596480 Just received the new Fox poll. Thank you, America! #Trump2016
690672420433178624 Wow! New National Zogby Poll just out:.TRUMP 45. CRUZ 13. RUBIO 8. Big numbers.

690636948864512000 The dying @NRO National Review has totally given up the fight against Barrack Obama. They have been losing for years. I will beat Hillary!
690585875365756928 Wow! This might be my highest # yet! Thank you to my opposition- you are totally ineffective & have been for years!
690560125916975104 After spending $89 million, @JebBush is at the bottom of the barrel in polls. He is ashamed to use the name Bush in ads. Low energy guy!
690540484154896384 The failing @NRO National Review Magazine has just been informed by the Republican National Committee that they cannot participate in debate
690532959363866625 Highly respected Constitutional law professor Mary Brigid McManamon has just stated, Ted Cruz is not eligible to be President. Big problem
690529690205818880 #TedCruz eligibility to be President not settled law, says Cruz' Constitutional Law Professor, #LaurenceTribe
690528062190944256 Ted Cruz complains about my views on eminent domain, but without it we wouldn't have roads, highways, airports, schools or even pipelines.
690382722162913280 The late, great, William F. Buckley would be ashamed of what had happened to his prize, the dying National Review!
690382619213742082 Very few people read the National Review because it only knows how to criticize, but not how to lead.
690382564494839809 National Review is a failing publication that has lost it's way. It's circulation is way down w its influence being at an all time low. Sad!
690337376061788161 Thank you, Iowa! #FITN #IACaucus
690336644281581568 Why does @Greta have a fired Bushy like dummy, John Sununu on- spewing false info? I will beat Hillary by a lot, she wants no part of Trump.
690315366564626433 Thank you, New Hampshire!

690272687168458754 Happy birthday to my friend, the great @jacknicklaus - a totally special guy!
690271688127213568 New Day on CNN treats me very badly. @AlisynCamerota is a disaster. Not going to watch anymore.
690180284189310976 Low energy candidate @JebBush has wasted $80 million on his failed presidential campaign. Millions spent on me. He should go home and relax!
690176882055114758 Sad sack @JebBush has just done another ad on me, with special interest money, saying I won't beat Hillary - I WILL. But he can't beat me.
690173226341691392 So sad that @CNN and many others refused to show the massive crowd at the arena yesterday in Oklahoma. Dishonest reporting!
690167662698110976 Wacko @glennbeck is a sad answer to the @SarahPalinUSA endorsement that Cruz so desperately wanted. Glenn is a failing, crying, lost soul!

689838094158168064 Great rally in Iowa! Such wonderful people. Traveling now with @SarahPalinUSA to Tulsa- massive crowd expected!

689576854089404416 Palin's brand among evangelicals is as gold as the faucets in Trump tower, said Ralph Reed, the chairman of the Faith & Freedom Coalition.
689519657414320128 Wow, the highly respected Governor of Iowa just stated that Ted Cruz must be defeated. Big shoker! People do not like Ted.
689510460819828736 A true honor to receive the endorsement of John Wayne's daughter....read:
689482404990361601 In the just released SC poll I increased my lead by 4 points since last poll by same firm. Up by 14! Cruz dropped 3.
689474228907716609 Thank you for your strong testimony when welcoming me to Liberty University, yesterday- @JerryJrFalwell.
689467901582020609 Thank you Georgia! I appreciate all of your support. #Trump2016
689466630741463040 @FreeJesseJames- Just read your complete statement. You are an amazing guy & I really appreciate your words & support. I will see you soon!
689463443791880192 On my way to Iowa- just received new national poll numbers. Thank you!
689458468835569664 Really disgusting that the failing New York Times allows dishonest writers to totally fabricate stories.
689458393283563524 Dope Frank Bruni said I called many people, including Karl Rove, losers-true! I never called my friend @HowardStern a loser- he's a winner!
689451985557331969 @tedcruz Conflicting Stances on Birthright Citizenship [14th Amendment] Gives #TeamTrump credit.
689429603614502913 Wow, new polls just out have Trump up and Cruz down - he is a nervous wreck!
689292259276226561 @TheBrodyFile great job on @AC360. Thank you for the very smart and kind words!
689275203151654912 @TheBrodyFile Exclusive: @realDonaldTrump Says He Will Protect Evangelicals Better Than @tedcruz #CBNNews #2016
689265377872867329 I don't think Ted Cruz can even run for President until he can assure Republican voters that being born in Canada is not a problem. Doubt!
689263744443138049 Ted Cruz is falling in the polls. He is nervous. People are worried about his place of birth and his failure to report his loans from banks!
689232143818579968 I loved being at Liberty University today! Record setting crowd, unbelievable people! Thank you Jerry and Becki!
689173145513791488 We launched a new series of #Trump2016 videos via Facebook. A new topic everyday! Watch:
689142431477010432 A great morning with everyone @LibertyU! Thank you! Off to New Hampshire now. #Trump2016
689097658976317444 Leaving for Liberty University. I'll be speaking today in front of a record crowd. #Trump2016
689097594182725632 Just a reminder that Ted Cruz supported liberal Justice John Roberts who gave us #Obamacare.
689096917817671682 Thank you @IvankaTrump for the kind words. I am very proud of the role model you are for so many. NH & IA radio ad:
688829594472939520 I am self-funding my campaign - putting up my own money, not controlled. Cruz is spending $millions on ads paid for by his N.Y. bosses.
688827531143806979 Far more killed than anticipated in radical Islamic terror attack yesterday. Get tough and smart U.S., or we won't have a country anymore!
688779451019210753 Big announcement in Ames, Iowa on Tuesday! You will not want to miss this rally! #Trump2016
688743019479171072 Iran is going to buy 114 jetliners with a small part of the $150 billion we are giving them...but they won't buy from U.S., rather Airbus!
688720409865383936 In Iran deal we get 4 prisoners. They get $150 billion, 7 most wanted and many off watch list. This will create great incentive for others!
688517545293406208 Interesting read from Peggy Noonan.
688445495174393856 Is this the New York that Ted Cruz is talking about & demeaning?
688443772565348352 Wow! Ted Cruz received $487K in campaign contributions, $11M from a NY hedge fund mogul, & $1M low int. loan from Goldman Sachs. Hypocrite
688428417235218433 Departing NH now- great morning with record crowd in Portsmouth- in a snow storm! Thank you!
688427218901532672 Greatly dishonest of @TedCruz to file a financial disclosure form & not list his lending banks- then pretend he is going to clean up Wall St
688426349652910080 When will @TedCruz give all the New York based campaign contributions back to the special interests that control him.
688426156920459264 Everybody that loves the people of New York, and all they have been thru, should get hypocrites like Ted Cruz out of politics!
688425749129211905 If Ted Cruz is so opposed to gay marriage, why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage?
688393139435008000 Ted is the ultimate hypocrite. Says one thing for money, does another for votes.
688355751463636992 Great new numbers. Thank you!
688352797251792896 Ted Cruz purposely, and illegally, did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks. They own him!
688335640925061124 Based on the fact that Ted Cruz was born in Canada and is therefore a natural born Canadian, did he borrow unreported loans from C banks?
688334268804804608 Oh no, just reported that Ted Cruz didn't report another loan, this one from Citi. Wow, no wonder banks do so well in the U.S. Senate.
688333063093374976 The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace. Remember, his wife's employer, and his lender, is located there!
688328034651361280 Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer!
688327093214662657 Ted Cruz said he didn't know that he was a Canadian Citizen. He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers.Not believable
688324874604023808 Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago. Lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow. I told you so
688190779773210626 More radical Islam attacks today - it never ends! Strengthen the borders, we must be vigilant and smart. No more being politically correct.
688183605491703812 @FrankLuntz is a total clown. Has zero credibility! @FoxNews @megynkelly
688179414585053184 @oreillyfactor please explain to the very dumb and failing @glennbeck that I supported John McCain big league in 2008, not Obama!
688175313348505600 Just got back from Iowa - had a great time with amazing people. Will be back soon!
688174117929881601 @GeraldoRivera Thank you Geraldo for your nice words on @oreillyfactor tonight. You are a true champion! Thank @ericbolling - great guy!
688105040104435712 Jusr watched #HarveyPitt on @TeamCavuto - he was great!
688084656072298496 Top searched candidate by state, as seen in the #GOPDebate media filing center. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
688020474744467460 Sen. Lindsey Graham embarrassed himself with his failed run for President and now further embarrasses himself with endorsement of Bush.
688017079996407808 Jeb Bush, who did poorly last night in the debate and whose chances of winning are zero, just got Graham endorsement. Graham quit at O.

687717134890307588 Do you think Iran would have acted so tough if they were Russian sailors? Our country was humiliated.
687706466124492800 @TheBrodyFile: Trump's appeal to evangelicals is real #Trump2016
687511035385909248 United States looks more and more like a paper tiger. Won't be that way if I win!
687510877835280384 Stuart Stevens is a dumb guy who fails @ virtually everything he touches. Romney campaign,his book,etc. Why does @andersoncooper put him on?
687510877847851008 Iran humiliated the United States with the capture of our 10 sailors. Horrible pictures & images. We are weak. I will NOT forget!
687490653153050625 Why does @CNN & @andersoncooper waste airtime by putting failed campaign strategist, Stuart Stevens - who lost BIG for Romney - on the show?
687436400958947328 @EricTrump- unbelievable job on #FoxNews with @greta. That was better than I could do! #Trump2016
687353545063030784 THANK YOU, IOWA! Highly respected @OANN @GravisMarketing poll just released. #VoteTrump #IowaCaucus
687338519732293633 My nomination would increase voter turnout. #VoteTrump
687279537323782144 Sadly, there is no way that Ted Cruz can continue running in the Republican Primary unless he can erase doubt on eligibility. Dems will sue!
687271496012664833 Thank you for your support last night, Iowa! #VoteTrump #Trump2016 #IACaucus #FITN #IAPolitics
687245182127964160 Iran toys with U.S. days before we pay them, ridiculously, billions of dollars. Don't release money. We want our hostages back NOW!
687148683712958464 Numerous polls have me beating Hillary Clinton. In a race with her, voter turnout will be the highest in U.S. history-I get most new voters!
687130047422042112 The State Of The Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time. New leadership fast!
687128203031375873 Just found out that @tedcruz is spending a fortune on Iowa push polls negative to me. Not nice, but OK! New polls are great.
687108096926330880 The #SOTU speech is really boring, slow, lethargic - very hard to watch!
687106714521464833 The Iran deal is terrible. Why didn't we get the uranium stockpile - it was sent to Russia. #SOTU
687105848699662336 New CBS poll. #Trump2016
687027364933550080 Another new Iowa poll just released. Thank you! #IACaucus #FITN
687008301356322817 Such a serious problem for Ted & the GOP. Great doubt, Dems will sue! Let's all work together to solve this problem.
686996181268983810 On my way to Cedar Falls, Iowa, now. Will be great--I love the people of Iowa!
686765292412878849 The Tonight Show begins in 5 minutes. Enjoy!
686764361600364545 @stuartpstevens horrible advise to Mitt Romney made victory an impossibility. Don't blame Mitt! Now Stevens can't get a job!
686753035637370881 Fantastic job on @CNN tonight. @kayleighmcenany is a winner! @donlemon
686741878579064832 Don't forget to watch The Tonight Show with the wonderful @jimmyfallon at 11:30 P.M. You will not be disappointed! @NBC
686740083265957889 Face The Nation's interview of me was the highest rated show that they have had in 15 years. Congratulations and WOW! @CBSNews @jdickerson
686726788144300032 @MajorCBS Major Garrett of @CBSNews covers me very inaccurately. Total agenda, bad reporter!
686725838746836992 Thank you Michael Harrison @Talkersmagazine for your kind words - greatly appreciated!
686682823932153856 Will be on @FallonTonight with @JimmyFallon on @NBC at 11:35pmE. Enjoy! #Trump2016
686643969657319426 @megynkelly recently said that she can't be wooed by Trump. She is so average in every way, who the hell wants to woo her!
686634552748584960 New Iowa poll. Thank you!
686626351449804803 @RinglingBros is retiring their elephants-- the circus will never be the same.
686626127213924356 Congratulations to @jdickerson of Face the Nation on his highest ratings in 15 years. 4.6 million people watched my interview! Thank you!
686573482461794304 Just arrived in New Hampshire. Thank you to all of my supporters!
686565549028044800 So professional of @ABC news to throw out the failing @UnionLeader newspaper from their debate. Paper won't survive, highly unethical!
686558650576539648 Great job on Fox this morning @KatiePavlich. I am sending out for your book immediately. Thank you very much!
686552786952130560 Congratulations to my friend @TheSlyStallone on winning a #GoldenGlobe. A wonderful guy- who has created something special- well deserved!
686552289516105728 Why does @ThisWeekABC w/ @GStephanopoulos allow a hater & racist like @tavissmiley to waste good airtime? @ABC can do much better than him!
686337471123197952 Thank you to our law enforcement officers! #LESM #Trump2016
686327439870574592 Union Leader refuses to comment as to why they were kicked out of the ABC News debate like a dog. For starters, try getting a new publisher!
686293133961871360 UL has lost all credibility under Joe McQuaid w circulation dropping to record lows. They aren't worthy of representing the great people NH.
686293040496009216 This is really unfair and a conflict for all the other candidates. I said it should not be allowed and ABC agreed.
686292962846871552 If their highly unethical behavior, including begging me for ads, isn't questionable enough, they have endorsed a candidate who can't win.
686292802708320258 I am pleased to announce that I had the Union Leader removed from the upcoming debate.
686280225731293184 Remember, get TIME magazine! I am on the cover. Take it out in 4 years and read it again! Just watch...
686254121435807744 Heading now for Reno, Nevada, for a big rally. Good poll numberd all over!
686253395024297984 In the just out @FoxNews Poll, I easily beat Hillary Clinton - and I havn't even focused on her yet. On our way: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
686252152042336256 Yesterday in Iowa was amazing - two speeches in front of two great sold out crowds. They love that I am the only candidate self-funding!
685977617145663492 I want to thank the people of Iowa for an unbelievable day. The crowds were amazing. Will be back Tuesday!
685977534983462912 Will be on Meet the Press with @ChuckTodd tomorrow morning. Enjoy!
685977438527078400 I will be interviewed by Chris Wallace on Fox tomorrow morning. Tune in!
685883989039656961 I'm protesting the @UnionLeader from having anything to do w/ ABC debate. Their unethical record doesn't give them the right to be involved!
685882772540534785 (2/2) David brilliantly tells it like it is -- the real deal! Read it!
685882755020898304 (1/2) Time Magazine has me on the cover this week. David Von Drehle has written one of the best stories I have ever had.
685873644308926464 Thank you so much. Earnest must have been a great person.
685855280798674944 @JonahNRO, watched on @seanhannity and appreciate your statements --- I have been waiting for them for a long time. Thank you.
685854865998884864 Thank you, @TheFix- Chris Cillizza. It is a true person of character that can change his opinion & do what is right.
685848940298776577 Constitutional law expert #Laurence Tribe of Harvard says wrong to say it (natural born citizen) is a settled matter-it isn't settled).
685829999467872256 South Carolina rally last night was so unbelievably exciting (and fun). I am now off to Iowa for two big rallies - packed houses. Love it!
685829026175401984 Pat Buchanan gave a fantastic interview this morning on @CNN - way to go Pat, way ahead of your time!
685644333022851072 Great even in SC tonight! Fire Marshall would not let everyone in-- 5,000 turned away. Thank you for coming!
685606815267221504 Will be at venue, in wonderful South Carolina, very soon. Big traffic back-up, tremendous crowd! Will be wild.
685600012043202560 #FoxNews Poll - THANK YOU!
685584095120887809 Love seeing union & non-union members alike are defecting to Trump. I will create jobs like no one else. Their #Dem leaders can't compete!
685582649679867904 I hope all workers demand that their @Teamsters reps endorse Donald J. Trump. Nobody knows jobs like I do! Don't let them sell you out!
685571686423461888 On my way to South Carolina. Big Crowd--- look forward to it!
685533340074688512 Not good news for Jeb Bush
685490467329425408 Hank Greenberg, formerly of AIG, gave $10 million to the @JebBush campaign 3 months ago. He is not happy, a total waste of money!
685296929656422401 Great time in Burlington, Vermont. Crowd was amazing.
685285573943279616 We could only get a small fraction of this 25k crowd in. The movement to Make America Great Again is unbelievable!
685207046921269249 I'm leaving now for Burlington, Vermont. It will be wild!
685205850558980097 Joy Behar, who was fired from her last show for lack of ratings, is even worse on @TheView. We love Barbara!
685205769030078466 The @TheView @ABC, once great when headed by @BarbaraJWalters, is now in total freefall. Whoopi Goldberg is terrible. Very sad!
685149937856819200 Hillary and her friends!
685136336920129536 Weak & ineffective @JebBush is doing ads where he shows his statement in the debate but not my response. False advertising!
685135364584017920 I have an idea for @JebBush whose campaign is a disaster. Try using your last name and don't be ashamed of it!
685132443393867776 @SenTedCruz Ted--free legal advice on how to pre-empt the Dems on citizen issue. Go to court now & seek Declaratory Judgment--you will win!
685130082646626305 Massive crowd in VT tonight. Venue not big enough. Officials say NO to outside event and sound system. Arrive early!
685089631973601280 Man shot inside Paris police station. Just announced that terror threat is at highest level. Germany is a total mess-big crime. GET SMART!
685087910169808896 I will be in beautiful Burlington, Vermont, tonight for a rally. Will be great fun. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
685060524548222976 It was a very wise move that Ted Cruz renounced his Canadian citizenship 18 months ago. Senator John McCain is certainly no friend of Ted!
685057265989189632 @Macys was one of the worst performing stocks on the S&P last year, plunging 46%. Very disloyal company. Another win for Trump! Boycott.
685054952754941952 The failing @UnionLeader newspaper in N.H. just sent The Trump Organization a letter asking that we take ads. How stupid, how desperate!
684875944352432128 Do you believe that @UnionLeader in NH was demanding ads? Look at enclosed letter from them, just received:
684844313528942599 I will be on @wolfblitzer for a @CNNSitRoom interview today. Please join us 5PM ET.
684832481414148096 Huge crowd expected tomorrow night! VT Police say first come, first serve. Arrive early!
684817323333693442 Don't like @SamuelLJackson's golf swing. Not athletic. I've won many club championships. Play him for charity!
684817275430539264 I don't cheat at golf but @SamuelLJackson cheatsÃ¢with his game he has no choiceÃ¢and stop doing commercials!
684751768522194944 HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my son, @EricTrump! Very proud of you!
684742583520722944 Germany is going through massive attacks to its people by the migrants allowed to enter the country. New Years Eve was a disaster. THINK!
684531959939371008 I am in New Hampshire. Just received great news from Reuters poll. Thank you for your support!
684429853433696258 I don't know @SamuelLJackson, to best of my knowledge haven't played golf w/him & think he does too many TV commercialsÃ¢boring. Not a fan.
684417452906774529 Wow @UnionLeader circulation in NH has dropped from 75,000 to around 10Ã¢bad management. No wonder they begged me for ads.
684197871009292292 The rally in Lowell, Massachusetts, was amazing. 10,000 people going wild. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
684102012141703170 Woody Johnson, owner of the NYJets, is @JebBush's finance chairman. If Woody would've been w/me, he would've been in the playoffs, at least!
684064699760115712 I look forward to being in Lowell, Massachusetts, today. I hear a very big crowd is expected--we will have lots of fun!
683789875653513220 By the way, Hillary & the MSM forgot to mention that Hillary is in the
683789635189882881 The worst thing Hillary could do is have her husband campaign for her. Just watch.
683739850185543681 Iran, with all of the money and all else given to them by Obama, has wanted a way to take over Saudi Arabia & their oil. THEY JUST FOUND IT!
683725499391164416 @RuthMarcus of the @washingtonpost was terrible today on Face The Nation.No focus, poor level of concentration-but correct on Hillary lying
683712803392323584 @chucktodd said today on @meetthepress that attacking Bill to get to Hillary has never worked before. Wrong - attacked him in '08 & won!
683708260784967680 Does anybody remember when Bill Clinton, in 2008, worked long and hard for Hillary? She LOST! Now Bill is at it again. Just watch.
683690682649833476 Thank you for your support in Biloxi, MS! Let's ALL get out & VOTE in 2016, so we can #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!
683655884547973121 Hillary said that guns don't keep you safe. If she really believes that she should demand that her heavily armed bodyguards quickly disarm!
683652037800755200 Al-Shabbab, not ISIS, just made a video on me - they all will as front-runner & if I speak out against them, which I must. Hillary lied!
683648845033680896 Hillary Clinton lied last week when she said ISIS made a D.T. video. The video that ISIS made was about her husband being a degenerate.
683522343680000000 Just returned from Mississippi - a great evening.
683511482684936192 Thank you #Biloxi, #Mississippi! Remember this night & spread the word to get out & #VoteTrump2016!
683443848639455232 Just arrived in Mississippi for the rally. Word is that the crowd is overflowing and massive. Will be an amazing evening!
683418056417251328 Heading to Biloxi, Mississippi. Massive crowds expected. Thank you for your support! #VoteTrump2016
683394224184758272 Remember, I am self-funding my campaign, the only one in either party. I'm not controlled by lobbyists or special interests-only the U.S.A.!
683392613869858816 When I look at all of the money the special interests and lobbyists are giving to candidates, beware - the candidates are mere puppets $$$$!
683378470093746176 I hope Bill Clinton starts talking about women's issues so that voters can see what a hypocrite he is and how Hillary abused those women!
683377290282156032 Hillary Clinton doesn't have the strength or stamina to be president. Jeb Bush is a low energy individual, but Hillary is not much better!
683277309969694720 Hillary Clinton said that it is O.K. to ban Muslims from Israel by building a WALL, but not O.K. to do so in the U.S. We must be vigilant!
683260753810440192 @JebBush is a low energy stiff who should focus his special interest money on the many people ahead of him in the polls. Has no chance!
683259029804695552 @JebBush is a sad case. A total embarrassment to both himself and his family, he just announced he will continue to spend on Trump hit ads!
683140004625936384 Massive crowds expected in Mississippi tomorrow night. Look forward to it! 2015 IN PHOTOS:
683128636279361537 #VoteTrump2016 & together we will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! THANK YOU for your support!
683127297457700864 Thank you so much to for naming me the 2015 Man of the Year. This is indeed a great honor for me!
683070410993364992 The person that Hillary Clinton least wants to run against is, by far, me. It will be the largest voter turnout ever - she will be swamped!
683066224251645953 I will be going to Mississippi tomorrow night - hear the crowds are going to be massive! Look forward to it.
683060169677344768 Well, the year has officially begun. I have many stops planned and will be working very hard to win so that we can turn our country around!
682428536855117825 @JebBush has spent $63,000,000 and is at the bottom of the polls. I have spent almost nothing and am at the top. WIN! @hughhewitt
682414759942184960 A GREAT day in South Carolina. Record crowd and fantastic enthusiasm. This is now a movement to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
682413776600174592 I predict that dying @UnionLeader newspaper, which has been run into the ground by publisher Stinky Joe McQuaid, will be dead in 2 years!
682319510251159553 A lovely letter from the daughter of the late great John Wayne. Our country could use a John Wayne right now.
682310784563720193 Great poll- thank you Nevada!
682297346240167936 I'm going to be live with @ericbolling and @kimguilfoyle to ring in the New Year 2016. Everybody should tune in to @foxnews tomorrow night!
682291228898115585 Thank you Hilton Head, South Carolina! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
682267088271110145 Thank you Hilton Head, South Carolina! @SCTeamTrump #Trump2016
682227816394522624 I never thought I'd be saying this but I've really enjoyed @RichLowry on television lately, and he was terrific hosting @seanhannity
682220279871979520 Joe McQuaid (@deucecrew) is desperately trying to sell the @UnionLeader. It's a loser, and my comments haven't helped him much.
682201111948824576 The dying @UnionLeader newspaper in NH is in turmoil over my comments about them- like a bully that got knocked out!
682186402621186049 Iowa was fantastic last night, amazing crowd and people. I'm now in Florida, getting ready to go to South Carolina. Big crowd, very exciting
682177311622467584 @CharlesHurt You were great on @seanhannity last night. Thanks for the nice words. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
682048994705584129 THANK YOU Council Bluffs, Iowa! The silent majority, is silent no more!
681997481740087296 Joe McQuaid (@deucecrew) of the dying Union Leader wanted ads, lunches, donations, speeches from me, and tweets---very unethical.
681997425356095488 The great people of New Hampshire, who I love, are not properly served by the dying Union Leader newspaper.
681997313925976066 Shows how dumb Joe McQuaid (@deucecrew) of the dying Union Leader is to put out the letter I wrote saying why I didn't do his failed debate!
681936877222494208 I hope @TGowdySC does better for Rubio than he did at the #Benghazi hearings, which were a total disaster for Republicans & America!
681917663514365952 We need a real President!
681910074906906624 Looking forward to being in Council Bluffs, Iowa, later today. Despite weather, rally is on -- will be fantastic! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!
681847012304797696 So, I have spent almost nothing on my run for president and am in 1st place. Jeb Bush has spent $59 million & done. Run country my way!
681845591027134464 My campaign for president is $35,000,000 under budget, I have spent very little (and am in 1st place).Now I will spend big in Iowa/N.H./S.C.
681816443093159937 Minorities line up behind.....Donald Trump #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
681696040458809345 @jessebwatters is terrific at hosting on @FoxNews - he really gets it!
681693955700948996 Remember that Bill Clinton was brought in to help Hillary against Obama in 2008. He was terrible, failed badly, and was called a racist!
681678252029665281 Thank you- Nashua, New Hampshire! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
681606884290265088 Thank you to a #Trump2016 supporter for this video of my campaign- over the past 6 months. Video:
681468264615165953 Strange, but I see wacko Bernie Sanders allies coming over to me because I'm lowering taxes, while he will double & triple them, a disaster!
681457163492024321 Wages in are country are too low, good jobs are too few, and people have lost faith in our leaders.We need smart and strong leadership now!
681455081699569664 Many of the great jobs that the people of our country want are long gone, shipped to other countries. We now are part time, sad! I WILL FIX!
681452215614222339 The middle-class has worked so hard, are not getting the kind of jobs that they have long dreamed of - and no effective raise in years. BAD
681447548133965824 If Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband, with his terrible record of women abuse, while playing the women's card on me, she's wrong!
681309464339832837 Hopefully the Republican National Committee can straighten out the total mess that is taking place in Virginia's Republican Party. FAST!
681157406605324288 Straighten out The Republican Party of Virginia before it is too late. Stupid! RNC
681155057136578563 @BernieSanders-who blew his campaign when he gave Hillary a pass on her e-mail crime, said that I feel wages in America are too high. Lie!
681148934685855744 The voters the Republican Party of Virginia are excluding will doom any chance of victory. The Dems LOVE IT! Be smart and win for a change!
681147489534119936 R.P.Virginia has lost statewide 7 times in a row. Will now not allow desperately needed new voters. Suicidal mistake. RNC MUST ACT NOW!
681143660705099776 It begins, Republican Party of Virginia, controlled by the RNC, is working hard to disallow independent, unaffiliated and new voters. BAD!
680947538896252928 I will do far more for women than Hillary, and I will keep our country safe, something which she will not be able to do-no strength/stamina!
680908733455708160 Hillary Clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but HE'S DEMONSTRATED A PENCHANT FOR SEXISM, so inappropriate!
680877571542790144 A new terror warning was issued for European cties. At what point do we say we have had enough and get really tough and smart. Weak leaders!
680752844220329984 Criminal deportations in the U.S. are the lowest number in many years. We are letting criminals knowingly stay in our country. MUST CHANGE!
680734915718176768 The Phoenix V.A., it has just been reported, is in worse shape than ever before. The wait is horrendous, and people are dying. I will fix it
680505672476262400 The same people that said I wouldn't run, or that I wouldn't lead or do well (1st place and leading by 21%), now say I won't beat Hillary.
680503951440121856 @chucktodd is so dishonest in his reporting...and to think he was going off the air until I came along-no ratings. I will beat Hillary!
680496083072593920 @CNN just announced that TRUMP was #1 story of 2015. Totally meaningless, however, if we don't WIN IT ALL and Make America Great Again!
680489467245936641 When will the Democrats, and Hillary in particular, say we must build a wall, a great wall, and Mexico is going to pay for it? Never!
680486088255909888 Our great VETERANS are being treated very badly because of corruption and incompetence at the V.A. That will stop, I will fix this quickly!
680484330494386176 Remember when failed candidate @JebBush said that illegals came across the border as AN ACT OF LOVE? He's spent $59 million and is at 3%.
680481995374329856 We have many problems in our house (country!), and we need to fix them before we let visitors come over and stay. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
680480963068051456 Does everyone see that the Democrats and President Obama are now, because of me, starting to deport people who are here illegally. Politics!
680472651756736512 @deedeesorvino was GREAT today on @FoxNews She gets what is going on in politics, and sees it very clearly. Have her on more!
680220409262911488 Merry Christmas to all. Have a great day and have a really amazing year. Together, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! It will be done!
680212039487340544 @danielhalper Great job on @CNN today. Very wise indeed!
680205355339497476 @HallieJackson Why didn't you report Hillary lying about the ISIS video. Bad reporting. Perhaps @NBC will do better next year-but doubt it!
680168300630937600 I am now in Palm Beach, Florida, and will be going to church tonight. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
680162068687925249 @meetthepress and @chucktodd very dishonest in not showing the new @CNN Poll where I am at 39%, 21points higher than Cruz. Be honest Chuck!
680160249991553024 Why isn't @chucktodd using the much newer @CNN Poll when discussing how well I am doing instead of the older Q Poll? CNN even better!
680156538598756352 Wow, because of the pressure put on by me, ICE TO LAUNCH LARGE SCALE DEPORTATION RAIDS. It's about time!
680154897518608389 Next year will be an interesting one. I look forward to running against Hillary Clinton, a totally flawed candidate, and beating her soundly
680153902952615936 Third rate reporters Amy Chozick and Maggie Haberman of the failing @nytimes are totally in the Hillary circle of bias. Think about Bill!
680151064188948480 Wow, even lowly Rand Paul has just past @JebBush in the new @CNN Poll. Jeb is at 3%, I'm at 39%. Stop throwing your money down the drain!
680149494214823937 In the ridiculous @JebBush ad about me, Jeb is speaking to me during the debate, but doesn't allow my answer, which destroys him - SO SAD!
680118305449996293 Poor @JebBush spent $50 million on his campaign, I spent almost nothing. He's bottom (and gone), I'm top (by a lot). That's what U.S. needs!
680112100547543040 A great Christmas movie & perfect #TBT! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
679864821823713284 Hillary said I really deplore the tone and inflammatory rhetoric of his campaign. I deplore the death and destruction she caused-stupidity
679843301890109440 Merry Christmas & Happy Holidays!
679802957089648640 Hillary, when you complain about a penchant for sexism, who are you referring to. I have great respect for women. BE CAREFUL!
679713305376780289 It is hard to believe I am winning by so much when I am treated so badly by the media. New @CNN Poll amazing in ALL categories. 21 pt. Lead
679691783467610113 Why does @FoxNews give @KarlRove so much airtime. He (and other Fox pundits) is so biased. Still thinks Romney won. Unfair coverage of Trump
679690180937314305 @FoxNews treats me so badly. Using old Quinnipiac Poll where I have a much smaller lead than the just out @CNN Poll. All negative!
679676684501692416 The @washingtonpost, which is the lobbyist (power) for not imposing taxes on #Amazon, today did a nasty cartoon attacking @tedcruz kids. Bad
679673029400641536 The silent majority- is silent no more! Remember the importance of VOTING!
679668017505144833 The Hillary Clinton staged event yesterday was pathetic. Be careful Hillary as you play the war on women or women being degraded card.
679643221526462465 Thank you America! Together- we will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!
679633151237439488 Big news just out - NEW @CNN POLL TRUMP 39 and leads in every major category. Likeability way up. CRUZ 18 CARSON 10 RUBIO 10
679542494523187200 We need a PRESIDENT with strength, stamina, heart and incredible deal making skill if our country is ever going to be able to prosper again!
679538962948571137 It is a shame that the biased media is able to so incorrectly define a word for the public when they know that the definition is wrong. Sad!
679506175239532545 When I said that Hillary Clinton got schlonged by Obama, it meant got beaten badly. The media knows this. Often used word in politics!
679496538117271552 Wow, new Reuters Poll just out. Big lead if you want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! TRUMP 37 CRUZ 11 This is at the top of Drudge!
679464490128293888 For those on TV defending my use of the word schlonged, bc #MSM is giving it false meaning-tell them it means beaten badly. Dishonest #MSM
679463530190499840 NPR's @NealConan said schlonged to WaPo re: 1984 Mondale/Ferraro campaign: That ticket went on to get schlonged at the polls. #Hypocrisy
679463426675097600 Once again, #MSM is dishonest. Schlonged is not vulgar. When I said Hillary got schlonged that meant beaten badly.
679433831032705024 Jeb's big ad buy against me, paid for by lobbyists, shows my face but doesn't have me answering Jeb's statements. He is really pathetic!
679431012120702976 Watching @CNN and consider @secupp to be one of the least talented people on television. Boring and biased!
679424477550272512 Women defy media narrative, love Trump at packed Michigan rally.
679412376890974208 @JebBush's opening and closing in the debate were said by all to be terrible--fumbled around, incoherent.
679412078407495680 Why doesn't @JebBush, in his ads, show my answer to his statement in the debate?
679411797657575424 Will @JebBush, in his phony advertising campaign, show himself asking me to apologize to his wife in the debate?
679411225156001793 @JebBush just took millions of $'s in special interest money to look like a tough guy. Will never work!
679410900751802368 Weak and low energy @JebBush, whose campaign is a disaster, is now doing ads against me where he tries to look like a tough guy.
679383917057605632 Video from Michigan last night. After asking for months, the media panned their cameras!
679347469973635072 Thank you - Michigan!
679314834060673024 Thank you - New Hampshire!
679126206797750272 THANK YOU Grand Rapids, Michigan! Time to end political correctness & secure our homeland!
679064247792443393 @HerschelWalker, thanks for your support- it is very much appreciated!
679030733432856578 Getting ready to leave for Michigan - will be an amazing evening! See you there.
679011289914568704 Do you think that Hillary Clinton will apologize to me for the lie she told about the video of me being used by ISIS. There is no video.
679002048734568448 Thanks @AndreaTantaros for all of your kind words and thoughts. Big progress is being made. Keep up the great work!
679000573241393154 A suicide bomber has just killed U.S. troops in Afghanistan. When will our leaders get tough and smart. We are being led to slaughter!
678992842468032513 It's the Democrats' total weakness & incompetence that gave rise to ISIS -- not a tape of Donald Trump that was an admitted Hillary lie!
678982347392438272 Phyllis Schlafly: Trump is 'last hope for America'
678958283651182593 Getting ready to go to the great State of Michigan. Big crowd tonight. Make America Great Again!
678921089565749248 Just out: TRUMP GOP DEBATE - 18,000,000. CLINTON DEMOCRAT DEBATE - 6,700,000. And they were on major network vs. cable!
678916493862678528 Hillary said with respect to ISIS, we are finally where we need to be. Do we want 4 more years of incompetent leadership? MAGA!
678905519797575680 I demand an apology from Hillary Clinton for the disgusting story she made up about me for purposes of the debate. There never was a video.
678904742198820864 Hillary said at debate ISIS is going to people showing videos in order to recruit more radical jihadistst. She made up story-want apology!
678903114250985472 Very sad what happened last night at the Miss Universe Pageant. I sold it 6 months ago for a record price. This would never have happened!
678797631250911232 @JebBush today said he didn't want to be the front-runner, he would rather be where he is now, 2%. That is the talk of a loser, can't win!
678791376201523201 Great poll out of Illinois! Thank you!
678769142376304640 @MissUniverse final 3 on now. Great people, great new owner @IMG. WATCH.
678738010188464128 My friend, @AriEmanuel of @IMG, bought the Miss Universe pageants from me and they are on tonight on #Fox! Tune in!
678722591230701568 It was really strange when Hillary was missing from the podium last night. Not very presidential!
678720849336250369 Hillary Clinton spokesperson admitted that their was no ISIS video of me. Therefore, Hillary LIED at the debate last night. SAD!
678714784905326594 @JebBush was terrible on Face The Nation today. Being at 2% and falling seems to have totally affected his confidence. A basket case!
678686794507010048 We need a #POTUS with great strength & stamina. Hillary does not have that.
678501512088297478 Hillary Clinton lied when she said that ISIS is using video of Donald Trump as a recruiting tool. This was fact checked by @FoxNews: FALSE
678420732343427072 @GStephanopoulos stupidly believes that Hillary wants to run against me because she said so. She says that so people believe it - opposite!
678355010703515648 Thank you America! @FoxNews post-debate poll with +/- from previous poll. #VoteTrump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
678341077364011008 Thank you Cedar Rapids, Iowa!
678295001391087616 President Obama spends so much time speaking of the so-called Carbon footprint, and yet he flies all the way to Hawaii on a massive old 747.
678242598448943104 See, Sanders backed Hillary on E-mails at the debate, hurting himself, and then she threw him under the bus (but failed). Disloyal person!
678005667505045505 Another new post-debate poll. THANK YOU! #VoteTrump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
677990258387116032 Thank you for all of your support! Most importantly - we need to get everyone out to VOTE! #VoteTrump2016
677956272889704452 The last thing our country needs is another BUSH! Dumb as a rock!
677952407196844032 @JebBush has embarrassed himself & his family with his incompetent campaign for President. He should remain true to himself.
677938965589188612 Weak & ineffective @JebBush is doing ads where he shows his statement in the debate but not my response. False advertising!
677917639604355072 I have an idea for @JebBush whose campaign is a disaster. Try using your last name & don't be ashamed of it!
677911755146846212 @MelindaDC Don't misrepresent in order to make a point. I was always tough on ISIS--as you'll find out after I get elected.
677892372164952064 As I have been saying. Only the beginning: ISIS Suspects Arrested in Turkey, 150 European Passports Seized.
677717239836094464 New Reuters poll - thank you!
677702212215308288 #ISIS is making $400M/year on oil. I have been saying it for years. We need to bomb the oil!
677659012389801985 There is no question who will handle the threat of terrorism best as #POTUS. #Trump2016
677550216967507968 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain I will be in Cedar Rapids,IA this Saturday. Get your tickets-
677340596500066304 Will be on @jimmykimmel in 20 minutes on @ABC. #Kimmel #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
677339850752806912 @GlennBeck got fired like a dog by #Fox. The Blaze is failing and he wanted to have me on his show. I said no - because he is irrelevant.
677291451529621504 I will be doing @oreillyfactor tonight at 8:00pmE from Mesa, Arizona - will be talking about the #GOPDebate & more.
677288086619820032 Will be on @jimmykimmel tonight at 11:35pmE on @ABC. #Kimmel #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
677206760021606400 Clear winner of the #GOPDebate. Thank you for your support!
677148554503127040 Hillary Clinton is weak and ineffective - no strength, no stamina.
677146400749056000 Jeb Bush had a tough night at the debate. Now he'll probably take some of his special interest money, he is their puppet, and buy ad's.
677140683174649858 Thank you for the nice words @ktmcfarland. The debate was interesting, and fun. Keep up the great work!
677139452033032193 Will be interviewed on the @oreillyfactor tonight at 8:00 P.M. Will be talking about the debate, and more!
677123407142510592 Bill O'Reilly calls Trump and campaign brilliant. In first place by 27 points.
677122599076302848 @MarkHalperin works so hard but just doesn't have a natural instinct for politics. Others do, and those are the people you want to follow!
677121102405984256 Thank you @davidaxelrod for your nice words this morning on @CNN. It was a good night!
677118427048218624 Thank you, so many people have given me credit for winning the debate last night. All polls agree. It was fun and interesting!
676980412875427845 Thank you, @FrankLuntz - for saying I was a winner tonight. It is my great honor. #Trump2016
676947988841910273 We're not talking about religion; we're talking about security. #GOPDebate
676935091822706689 Departing for #GOPDebate. Let's #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!
676902775536623616 Highly respected PUBLIC POLICY POLLING (PPP) just announced that I am number one in IOWA. Thank you!
676880260667805696 New PPP poll just released in Iowa- up 6 points from last poll. Leading w/ 28%! Don't worry - media won't report it!
676876941673140224 @ConradMBlack, what an honor to read your piece. As one of the truly great intellects & my friend, I won't forget!
676818721223000064 . #JoeTheismann was great as a political analyst on @FoxNews. He knows far more than football. Thanks for the nice words Joe!
676814742313242624 I won every debate so far according to all debate polls including @DRUDGE_REPORT, @TIME @Slate and more. Too bad dopey @megynkelly lies!
676812123322781696 Between Iraq war monger @krauthammer, dummy @KarlRove, deadpan @GeorgezWill, highly overrated @megynkelly, among others, @FoxNews not fair!
676790691775643648 I am in Trump International Hotel, Las Vegas, getting ready and waiting for the debate tonight. Look forward - hope I get treated fairly!
676789004356816896 I wonder if @megynkelly and her flunkies have written their scripts yet about my debate performance tonight. No matter how well I do - bad!
676787403579756544 @megynkelly is very bad at math. She was totally unable to figure out the difference between me and Cruz in the new Monmouth Poll 41to14.
676786396036661248 @megynkelly, the most overrated anchor at @FoxNews, worked hard to explain away the new Monmouth poll 41 to 14 or 27 pt lead. She said 15!
676777302059974656 Why isn't anyone using the @CNN Iowa Poll with me having a big lead. They only want to use the one negative poll (2nd place).Dishonest press
676775704743186433 Isn't it amazing that @CNN paid a fortune for an Iowa Poll, which shows me in first place over Cruz by 13%, 33% to 20% - then doesn't use it
676770949451022337 Wow, I just had two very good Iowa polls and a phenomenal just out National Poll from @ABC @washingtonpost - 38%. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
676763189174931456 Thank you for your support! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
676629461052166144 What an evening in Las Vegas, Nevada! THANK YOU for your continued support. #Trump2016
676580376249110532 @oreillyfactor, horrible defense of me against highly overrated @krauthammer. I will bring more people into the party & easily beat Hillary!
676571597285687296 Why doesn't @CNN use the #CNN Iowa poll? @andersoncooper @andydean2014
676559160318803968 Thank you @CarlHigbie. Great work on @CNN. #Trump2016
676557511458226177 Thank you @hardball_chris for your nice words. They are very much appreciated. I fully understand that you really get it.
676540954325708800 Can't believe Major League Baseball just rejected @PeteRose_14 for the Hall of Fame. He's paid the price. So ridiculous - let him in!
676528489105879042 @scottienhughes - you were fantastic on CNN. Thank you for the nice words. See you at the #GOPDebate.
676513450080739328 @PatrickBuchanan was great on @TeamCavuto @FoxNews. Thank you Pat! #Tump2016

676279366184247298 Why doesn't @FoxNews quote the new Iowa @CNN Poll where I have a 33% to 20% lead over Ted Cruz and all others. Think about it!
676198180757852160 People have got to stop working to be so politically correct and focus all of their energy on finding solutions to very complex problems!
676167468780412929 I was disappointed that Ted Cruz would speak behind my back, get caught, and then deny it. Well, welcome to the wonderful world of politics!
676165531695783936 I did interview with Chris Wallace of @FoxNews in order to be fair. He then puts on Rove, Lane and Will, three Trump bashers, to discuss.
676156511039590400 Many think that the Championship Course at Turnberry, home of The Duel In The Sun, will be the worlds best after the renovation.
676093580365156352 A very good NBC/Wall Street Journal Poll was just released wherein I went up from last month and am in the lead. Nice!
676089401219358720 @danawhite Great job last night - very exciting! You have come a long way from those difficult early days, I am proud of you.
676076928382722048 People that have read it tell me that @KarlRove book is terrible (and boring). Save your money! @FoxNews should can him, no credibility!
676028565494874113 Chris Wallace @fox at 10:00 A.M.
676020786705137664 @CNN @jaketapper at 9:00 A.M.
676019767401127936 @Peggynoonannyc An election between Hillary and myself will be the biggest voter turnout in U.S. history. Just like the debates 24 M vs 2M.
676018460250537984 @Peggynoonannyc Interesting article, but I will beat Hillary easily. People that have given up on the system will come out to vote for me!
675910224855855104 Something must be done with dopey @KarlRove - he is pushing Republicans down the same old path of defeat. Don't fall for it, Karl is a loser
675902321482727424 I will be interviewed on @jaketapper @CNN at 9:00 A.M. and Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace at 10:O0 A.M. CNN Iowa Poll -13 point lead!
675827465353306112 I will be on CNN's - State of the Union tomorrow morning at 9amE.

675756151322058753 Reports say #ISIS now has a passport machine to have its believers infiltrate our country. I told you so.
675755354429460485 John Podesta says nominee will be Cruz b/c last person Hillary wants to face is Trump! Use your head folks! 46-41!
675692032380289025 Getting the support of @DanaWhite of UFC means a lot. A total winner, who has done an amazing job. Just ordered his fight to watch tonight!

675440875820969984 I will not let you down!
675432232492916736 Tom Ridge is a failed 'Bushy' & PA Governor. Him & his friend @KarlRove shouldn't be allowed to do their bias commentary- nobody listens!
675429342034403328 Tom Ridge should be focused on trying to bring the party together rather than ripping it apart w/ your faulty thought process. I will win!
675418949547384832 Never get good #'s from failing Des Moines Register/Bloomberg. I think something's going on w/them. Up 13 in IA according to respected CNN.
675417305862569985 Great news in Georgia! The just out Landmark poll shows me in first with 43%! Wow.

675300062403108864 @chucktodd is a nice guy , but just hopeless. He knows so little about politics and, in particular, winning! I fixed his rating problem.
675298842200440832 @Morning_Joe just went off the rails. I will beat Hillary easily - she does not want to run against me. I am tuning them out, waste of time
675297372642148352 @tedcruz should not make statements behind closed doors to his bosses, he should bring them out into the open - more fun that way!
675296416529534976 Looks like @tedcruz is getting ready to attack. I am leading by so much he must. I hope so, he will fall like all others. Will be easy!
675295251515445248 @Morning_Joe is so off on Iowa, which I am leading big in new @CNN poll. I will win Iowa. Also, I beat Hillary easily!

675011172496723968 Establishment flunky @KarlRove is going crazy with the just released CBS poll that has me way ahead. New Fox poll has me beating Hillary.
675010496723083265 Dummy @KarlRove continues to make and write false statements. He still thinks Romney won--he should get a life!

674936832010887168 Thank you to respected columnist Katie Hopkins of Daily for her powerful writing on the U.K.'s Muslim problems.
674934005725331456 The United Kingdom is trying hard to disguise their massive Muslim problem. Everybody is wise to what is happening, very sad! Be honest.

674812864834772993 @Megynkelly spent a big part of her show talking about other shows spending so much time on me. Really weird, she's being driven crazy!
674806914904137729 Weak and totally conflicted people like @TheRickWilson shouldn't be allowed on television unless given an I.Q. test. Dumb as a rock! @CNN

674777043163332608 Why does @CNN bore their audience with people like @secupp, a totally biased loser who doesn't have a clue. I hear she will soon be gone!
674774413095673856 @secupp, who can't believe that her candidate has bombed so badly, is one of the dumber pundits on T.V. Hard to watch, zero talent! @CNN

673736828982321152 Thank you Graham Ledger of the Daily Ledger @OANN for your really fair coverage and your great interview with Peter Roff of U.S. NEWS & W.R.
673679711437004805 Well, Obama refused to say (he just can't say it), that we are at WAR with RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS.
673675346030542848 Should have gone after the oil years ago (like I have been saying).
673675062600466433 Wish Obama would say ISIS, like almost everyone else, rather than ISIL.
673672413863927808 Is that all there is? We need a new President - FAST!

672877439400460290 @JRubinBlogger one of the dumber bloggers @washingtonpost only writes purposely inaccurate pieces on me. She is in love with Marco Rubio?
672876853120626688 The horrible shooting that took place in San Bernardino was an absolute act of terror that many people knew about. Why didn't they report?
672826404531257344 @marthamaccallum Martha, great interview with my son @EricTrump -- smart, tough & professional. Thank you! @FoxNews

672498342656634880 It was recently reported that 3rd rate $ losing @Politico is a foil for the Clintons. Questions given to Clinton in advance. No credibility.

672382998499753985 Congratulations on the GREAT job done by POLICE and law enforcement on the California shootings. Give credit where credit is due.
672203184069300224 Heading to Manassas, Virginia, for a rally. Will have a moment of silence for the victims of the California shootings. So sad!
672201832761040896 #TeamTrump. Police and law enforcement seem to have killed one of the California shooters and are in a shootout with the others. Go police

672149956208271360 Thank you CBS & Breitbart-total vindication! Will the mainstream media apologize? Many, many witnesses.

671876653522505728 The truth continues to come out after 14 years. A truth that many in the media did not want to tell. #Trump2016
671807635759345665 Just arrived in New Hampshire. Another packed venue! Will be fun.
671792709292720129 You would think a paper like the Washington Post would be fair and objective. For the record, almost all polls showed I won all debates.
671792600052027393 Highly untalented Wash Post blogger, Jennifer Rubin, a real dummy, never writes fairly about me. Why does Wash Post have low IQ people?
671756384694870016 Order a signed copy of CRIPPLED AMERICA & submit a question for my live streaming book signing on 12/3 at 7:30 pm
671723475418144768 What is Obama thinking?

671710514007904256 Look at the editorial I was just sent from the NY Post on 9/14/01 - 3 days after collapse of WTC. Any apologies?
671709367482347521 Jamiel Shaw was incredible on @foxandfriends this morning. His son, who was viciously killed by an illegal immigrant, is so proud of pop!
671706994336768000 I want to thank all my friends in Macon for the special evening and great reception. What a crowd of incredible people!
671698489735270400 A signed copy of CRIPPLED AMERICA makes a great gift. Order & join my live streaming book signing event on 12/3

671437896088440832 Meeting with African American Pastors at Trump Tower was amazing. Wonderful news conference followed. Now off to Georgia for big speech!
671394946721685504 We need a great leader- now!
671353097575362560 We better be vigilant, careful, and strong.
671348849647198208 The Republican establishment, out of self preservation, is concerned w/ my high poll #'s. More concerned are DemsÃ¢I beat Hillary heads up!
671330229596659712 How is Chris Christie running the state of NJ, which is deeply troubled, when he is spending all of his time in NH? New Jerseyans not happy!
671329839408930816 Wow, the MSM is really going after me. 12,000 in Sarasota, a love fest, hardly a mention. Only one negativity - they only want negatives!
671308887178551296 When will @CNN get some real political talent rather than political commentators like Errol Louis, who doesn't have a clue! Others bad also.
671137901959356417 Great job @MariaTCardona on @ThisWeekABC. You made kooky Cokie Roberts and @BillKristol look even dumber than they are. You will be right!
671081632422567936 After my meeting with the pastors, it's off to Georgia for a big rally - many thousands of great people will be there, a beautiful movement!
671080580939964417 Will be meeting on Monday at Trump Tower with a large group of African American Pastors. Many I know-wonderful people! Not a press event.
671079078502514692 Just watched Cookie Roberts on @ABC. Her predictions have been so wrong for so long that she has lost all credibility. Just another sad case
670815295091683328 @CNN has to do better reporting if it wants to keep up with the crowd.So totally one-sided and biased against me that it is becoming boring
670812287754747906 I will be on @meetthepress in an interview with @chucktodd on Sunday morning. So much to talk about!
670759653408710658 The Sarasota, Florida, rally today was amazing. 12,000 people chanting their love for our country. It's going to happen, this is a MOVEMENT!
670754851203227649 @CNN Kayleigh McEnany was great on you network today. You should have her on more often! Thank you Kayleigh for your nice words.
670690162687549440 Sarasota was an unbelievable success. We expected 5,000, a record, but 12,000 showed up! Great love in the air!
670645029082439680 We boarded the helicopter for Sarasota earlier & will be landing soon! See you there. #Trump2016
670612687907344384 Virtually no-one has spent more money in helping the American people with disabilities than me. Will discuss today at my speech in Sarasota
670611222342074368 The reporter who pulled-back from his 14 year old never retracted story is having fun. I don't know what he looks like and don't know him!
670560775971426304 I will be going to Sarasota, Florida, today for a big rally with amazing people! I have one goal on mind: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
670381849416482817 223 national polls & 33 pollsters.
669995673945808896 The failing @nytimes should focus on fair and balanced reporting rather than constant hit jobs on me. Yesterday 3 boring articles, today2!
669994161911779329 I do not know the reporter for the @nytimes, or what he looks like. I was showing a person groveling to take back a statement made long ago!
669992629241831424 Great new poll numbers! Thank you for your support! #Trump2016
669861224465743872 Happy Thanksgiving to all. Have a great day and look forward to the future. We will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
669694813005094912 The numbers at the @nytimes are so dismal, especially advertising revenue, that big help will be needed fast. A once great institution-SAD!
669692360465514496 So, since the people at the @nytimes have made all bad decisions over the last decade, why do people care what they write. Incompetent!
669690995857080320 The dopes at the @nytimes bought the Boston Globe for $1.3 billion and sold it for $1.00. Their great old headquarters-gave it away! So dumb
669689398112460800 The @nytimes is so poorly run and managed that other family members are looking to take over control. With unfunded liabilities-big trouble!
669687491100844032 The failing @nytimes should be focused on good reporting and the papers financial survival and not with constant hits on Donald Trump!
669682774673137665 Credible Source on 9-11 Muslim Celebrations: FBI
669672417774694400 I LIVE IN NEW JERSEY & @realDonaldTrump IS RIGHT: MUSLIMS DID CELEBRATE ON 9/11 HERE! WE SAW IT!
669600501483220992 Thank you for your continued support!
669510996504010752 @KarlRove just totally bombed on @Morning_Joe. @FoxNews has him on even though he has lost all credibility - a loser! Fox should dump Rove.
669506636092997632 South Carolina was so great last night. Will be back soon!
669498673378811905 Why would @greta use @KarlRove as an election analyst when he has made so many mistakes. He still thinks Romney won. An establishment dope!
669377527144665088 Myrtle Beach, South Carolina
669374049693409280 A wonderful evening in South Carolina - big crowd, amazing energy!
669288695938289665 New @OANN national poll released. Thank you America! #Trump2016
669277496802713601 Thank you for your nice words @MikeNeedham @Heritage for the nice words on @FoxNewsSunday with Chris Wallace. #FNS #Trump2016
669275236160954372 What is Frank VanderSloot getting for agreeing to back Marco Rubio? Last victim was Mitt Romney - see how that turned out.
669273221993222144 @BradPaisley came up to see me. A really nice and talented guy.
669261326125015043 Will be doing @seanhannity at 10 PM on @FoxNews. As always with Sean, will be interesting!
669257715525488640 Heading to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Really big crowdÃ¢so much to talk about!
669244676176760833 Republicans must stop relying on losers like @KarlRove if they want to start winning presidential elections. Be tough and get smart!
668974414348816384 Just left Columbus rally of 14,000 people --- a far bigger crowd than even I expected! Unbelievable evening, incredible spirit in the arena!
668916575492317184 Heading for Ohio - really big crowd of amazing people! Much to talk about!
668914875557629953 Going to Ohio, home of one of the worst presidential candidates in history--Kasich. Can't debate, loves #ObamaCare--dummy!
668875808585465856 @WSJ reports that @GOP getting ready to treat me unfairlyÃ¢big spending planned against me. That wasn't the deal!
668867262456156160 Via @washingtonpost 9/18/01. I want an apology! Many people have tweeted that I am right!
668863074586238976 When you do your Christmas shopping remember how disloyal @Macys was to the subject of illegal immigration. #BoycottMacys #DumpMacys
668833833589063682 Hillary, there is nothing to laugh about-
668827894630731776 Going to Columbus, Ohio today for a tremendous rally of thousands. The silent majority is no longer silent!
668827139232423936 @AP has one of the worst reporters in the business -- @JeffHorwitz wouldn't know the truth if it hit him in the face.
668827020718161920 @AP continues to do extremely dishonest reporting. Always looking for a hit to bring them back into relevancyÃ¢ain't working!
668594331968778241 @MatthewJDowd thank you for the nice comments recently, especially on @BarbaraJWalters. My family & I greatly appreciate your kind words.
668563843904380928 Hillary Clinton is weak on illegal immigration, among many other things. She is strong on corruption - corruption is what she's best at!
668495716139036673 Great poll numbers! Thank you!
668458837670805504 We better get tough with RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS, and get tough now, or the life and safety of our wonderful country will be in jeopardy!
668457318267400193 13 Syrian refugees were caught trying to get into the U.S. through the Southern Border. How many made it? WE NEED THE WALL!
668441539643899905 Great poll numbers all over and beating Hillary Clinton one on one. Thank you!
668406922232659968 Big new @ABC Poll to be announced at 9:00 A.M. on This Week with @GStephanopoulos. I will be interviewed on show!
668405215654240256 @GStephanopoulos just announced that I am leading BIG in the new @ABC Poll which will be shown on This Week at 9:00 A.M. I will be on show
668402717241548800 Will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:00 A.M.
668255736758145024 I find that @Reuters is a far more professional operation than @AP.
668255569996853248 .ccolvinj @AP is one of the truly bad reporters---working for an organization that has totally lost its way. Stories are fictional garbage.
668184376472117250 @heytana, great job - we are all proud of you!
668167333404352512 Thank you to all law enforcement agencies for a fabulous job!
668167155897249792 Thank you for a great afternoon Birmingham, Alabama! #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
668160214122799104 It's too bad so few people showed up to @bobvanderplaats Family Leader dinner. Next year I'll try & be there- and they'll have a huge crowd!
668092663376322560 Thank you John Nolte for wonderful analysis & reporting.
668090367284281344 Rumor has it - Pataki, Kasich, & Senator Lindsey Graham are dropping out of the race very soon. Hope it's not true, they're so easy to beat!
668088177513598976 So nice when media properly polices media. Thank you @BreitbartNews.
668087244729786368 A woman who got fired after two days of working with Scott Walker - a wacko - now trying to raise funds to fight me.
668075477547003904 Heading to Birmingham, Alabama, and a massive crowd of incredible people! 12 noon - will be wild.
668075223443447808 To show you how politicians act, Bobby Jindal spent $1,000 to register in New Hampshire & dropped out the next day. Such a waste!
668073641528197120 We're stuck with the worst mayor in the United States. Too bad, but New York City will survive!
668054560523599872 People are really liking my new book, Crippled America. Check it out!
667898301048557568 Join us at 10pmE on @ABC2020 @ABC with @BarbaraJWalters! #MeetTheTrumps #ABC2020

667862319091875841 Looking forward to watching the legendary @BarbaraJWalters interview my family (and me) tonight on @ABC at 10:00. Many things to talk about!
667856908548722688 Tune into the legendary @BarbaraJWalters at 10pmE on @ABC2020 tonight. #MeetTheTrumps for a full hour @ABC #ABC2020!
667856744677310465 @washingtonpost @BretBaier Please thank Charles Lane for his new found confidence. He has made a very good bet!
667854350270746624 @Gracematters Thank you, a very wise bet! Best wishes.
667837674527580160 Just got back from South Carolina. Going to Alabama tomorrow!
667819443196588032 @HillaryClinton is weak on illegal immigration & totally incompetent as a manager and leader - no strength or stamina to be #POTUS!
667814049342623744 The legendary @BarbaraJWalters interviews my family and me tonight at 10:00 on @ABC2020 . Don't miss it!
667798204394700800 @BilldeBlasio should focus on running #NYC & all of the problems that he has caused with his ineptitude, & not be so focused on me!
667797935686557696 Can you believe the worst Mayor in the U.S., & probably the worst Mayor in the history of #NYC, @BilldeBlasio, just called me a blow hard!
667788920697053184 Thank you for a great afternoon, South Carolina! See you next Tuesday! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
667777348029292544 I didn't suggest a database-a reporter did. We must defeat Islamic terrorism & have surveillance, including a watch list, to protect America
667736232831680512 Under our President, ISIS is gaining great strength-
667725171801907201 My family has the honor of being interviewed for a full hour by the legendary @BarbaraJWalters tonight @ABC - 10pmE.
667719816552296449 @mkhammer, a Fox contributor, isn't smart enough to know what is going on at the border. @TheJuanWilliams made the point far better!
667711609922527232 Going to South Carolina now, great place, SRO crowd. Iowa was amazing yesterday!
667688972840210432 The media must denigrate ISIS at all levels or youth will continue to be drawn to it. These are low level degenerates, NOT masterminds!
667686386653388800 The media must immediately stop calling ISIS leaders MASTERMINDS. Call them instead thugs and losers. Young people must not go into ISIS!
667536527141027840 A wonderful afternoon in Iowa! Great people! Heading now to Florida - tomorrow, South Carolina! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
667529956155633664 A great evening in Iowa! Thank you Des Moines Area Community College for a great forum! #Trump2016 #IAForums
667521691015319552 John Kasich was managing director of Lehman Brothers when it crashed, bringing down the world and ruining people's lives. A total failure!
667519608505659392 Once John Kasich announced he was running for president, and opened his mouth, people realized he was a complete & total dud!
667509409120043008 John Kasich fell right into President Obama's trap on ObamaCare, and the people of Ohio are suffering for it. Shame!
667509367881641984 Doesn't help Kasich to do negative ads on me because he still has to go through everyone else - he's almost last.
667509279507615748 I loved beating John Kasich in the debates, but it was easyÃ¢he came in dead last!
667509225535311872 Kasich has already spent $6 million on ads in New Hampshire and his numbers have gone down. People from NH are smart!
667509177707659264 Watch Kasich squirm --- if he is not truthful in his negative ads I will sue him just for fun!
667509134514786308 I want to do negative ads on John Kasich, but he is so irrelevant to the race that I don't want to waste my money.
667509055867346944 John Kasich, despite being Governor of Ohio, is losing to me in the Ohio polls. Pathetic!
667508977521917952 John Kasich should focus his special interest money on building up his failed image, not negative ads on me.
667508888074190848 Governor Kasich, whose failed campaign & debating skills have brought him way down in the polls, is going to spend $2.5 million against me.
667455972537974790 The legendary Barbara Walters interviews Melania Trump and me on a special this Friday night at 10:00 on ABC. Don't miss it!
667454484172312580 Thank you Worcester, Massachusetts!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
667440398948810753 Just the beginning & it is going to get worse. Rates & deductibles are so high nobody is going to be able to use it.
667433091590418432 I told you! Premiums are soaring! #RepealObamacare #Trump2016
667410168855048193 Thank you for your support! Together we can #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! #Trump2016
667404966248755200 The POLICE in Paris did a fantastic job. Very brave - not easy!
667379374639984640 Everyone is now saying how right I was with illegal immigration & the wall. After Paris, they're all on the bandwagon.
667329429912338432 Eight Syrians were just caught on the southern border trying to get into the U.S. ISIS maybe? I told you so. WE NEED A BIG & BEAUTIFUL WALL!
667060531149316097 Via Politico: Trump Extends Lead in New Hampshire Poll
667055916265709568 Very nice article from Daily Mail
667002902402179072 How does Ben Carson survive this problem Ã¢ really big. Similar story on front page of New York Times.
666815224788422656 Thank you for all of your support! Let's #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! #Trump2016
666753109314674695 The great Barbara Walters interviews Melania Trump and me on a Special Friday night at 10:00 on ABC.Ã¢Â¦
666747465417285633 I will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight at 10:00 on @FoxNews . Much, much, much to talk about!
666726734604189696 Melania and I just had interview with the legendary @BarbaraJWalters. Watch #abc2020 this Friday. Tonight we talk ISIS @WNTonight
666719680179085313 @AP is doing very badly. I can say from experience their reporting is terrible & highly inaccurate. Sadly, they are now irrelevant!
666719598935412737 One of the saddest things in journalism is what happened to the formerly great @AP. They have lost their way and are no longer credible.
666640736893448196 What is our President doing?
666632243490762752 GOP Voters Trust Donald Trump to Keep Our Country Safe
666615398574530560 Refugees from Syria are now pouring into our great country. Who knows who they are - some could be ISIS. Is our president insane?
666606474613886976 I, along with almost everyone else, have so little confidence in President Obama. He has a horrible attitude-a man who is resigned to defeat
666605421751361536 So many great polls like Reuters - big leads everywhere. New Hampshire really special! We will win big and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
666459170552553472 Thank you Tennessee! #Trump2016
666449082576187392 Just received a copy of @SarahPalinUSA new book -- a great read! Sarah is a terrific person.
666439765433196544 Great poll numbers out of @UMassAmherst. Thank you! #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
666431694346416128 Just leaving Knoxville, TN --- what a crowd, what amazing people! #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
666392650468220928 Just landing in Knoxville, Tennessee! Massive crowd expected! Will all have a great time, despite serious subject matter.
666388282905903104 I agree! The headline says it all. #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
666387100917473280 Discussing #SyrianRefugees with @EricBolling on @FoxNews back on 10/3/2015. #ISIS
666371999757959168 Will be landing in Knoxville, Tennessee shortly - tremendous crowd expected. It's all very simple, we want to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!
666350957807206400 Republicans must stop listening to dopes like @KarlRove who still insists Mitt Romney won the last election. Think big & think strong!
666326700666560512 Wow, @Macys shares are down more than 40% this year. I never knew my ties & shirts not being sold there would have such a big impact!
666325148547551233 Interesting article from highly respected Wayne Allyn Root
666235142445408256 Remember, I was the one who said attack the oil (ISIS source of wealth) a long time ago. Everyone scoffed, now they're attacking the oil.
666060370692448256 Tom Brady just did it again. He is not only a great guy, he is, without question, the BEST quarterback!
666058941760012288 President Obama just told President Putin how important the Russian air strikes against ISIS have been. I TOLD YOU SO!
666057546466111488 @JohnLegere @TMobile John, focus on running your company, I think the service is terrible! Try hiring some good managers.
666045638245810176 Glad to see that @RondaRousey lost her championship fight last night. Was soundly beaten - not a nice person!
666039755038150656 I have watched sloppy Graydon Carter fail and close Spy Magazine and now am watching him fail at @VanityFair Magazine. He is a total loser!
666037735606657024 @VanityFair Magazine is doing really poorly. It has gotten worse and worse over the years, and has lost almost all of it's former allure!
665994719554572293 We need strong, tough and brilliant leadership now more than ever! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
665994182973083648 I had a great time in Texas yesterday. A tremendous crowd of wonderful and enthusiastic people. Will be back soon!
665991098549075968 @realDonaldTrump on ISIS&OIL FIELDS! Saying it for years! @AndersonCooper, you should acknowledge this! #Trump2016
665896711685087237 When will President Obama issue the words RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM? He can't say it, and unless he will, the problem will not be solved!
665740405888126976 I think everyone will like my new and very successful book, Crippled America. Go get it and let me know what you think!
665739096694870017 Wow, Bernie Sanders just admitted that the real unemployment rate is 10% (it is actually over 20%) and for African American youth - 51%.
665735985704095744 Hillary and Sanders are not doing well, but what is the failed former Mayor of Baltimore doing on that stage? O'Malley is a clown.
665733681009569792 Why won't President Obama use the term Islamic Terrorism? Isn't it now, after all of this time and so much death, about time!
665731237487714304 Great news out of New Hampshire! DonaldTrump is pulling away from the pack w/ 2nd is 17% behind him! #Trump2016
665525201589936128 We need much tougher, much smarter leadership - and we need it NOW!
665524569961287680 President Obama said ISIL continues to shrink in an interview just hours before the horrible attack in Paris. He is just so bad! CHANGE.
665316238806007809 My prayers are with the victims and hostages in the horrible Paris attacks. May God be with you all.
665286593025036289 Boy is this guy @ShepNewsTeam tough on me. So totally biased. As a reporter, he should be ashamed of himself! #Trump2016
665282108861083648 They laughed at me when I said to bomb the ISIS controlled oil fields. Now they are not laughing and doing what I said. #Trump2016
665281923175071745 Thank you @JakeTapper for giving me credit for my vision on bombing the oil fields. Should have been done long ago. #Trump2016
665275716041351168 Great honor to be inducted into the NJ Boxing Hall of Fame last night. Thank you! Timing could not have been better!
665273935508938753 @seanhannity Carly, whose campaign is dead, is making false statements about me in order to salvage hope! Sad.
665271882774650880 @CarlyFiorina had to inject herself into my factual statements concerning Ben Carson in order to breathe life into her failing campaign!
665262407254728704 @CarlyFiorina I only said I was on @60Minutes four weeks ago with PutinÃ¢never said I was in Green Room. Separate piecesÃ¢great ratings!
665262326577262596 @CarlyFiorina Ben Carson said in his own book that he has a pathological temper & pathological disease. I didn't say it, he did. Apology?
665261941913440257 @CarlyFiorina CarlyÃ¢I did graduate from Wharton and did very well. Who is your fact checker? Will you apologize?
665261863941337089 @CarlyFiorina Carly, not just you, I also told Gov. Kasich to let Jeb talk, give him a chance because Kasich was constantly cutting in.
665199220136222720 Happy Friday the 13th
665002786766065664 Thank you Iowa! I appreciate all of your support @IowaCentral & @ethanolbyPOET this evening! #Trump2016 #IACaucus
664949765453443072 First candidate in Virginia with over 16,000 validated signatures for the ballot. An honor - thank you! #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
664923008117686272 I will be on @OutFrontCNN with @ErinBurnett at 7PM. Tune in!
664922906833588224 I will be on with @BretBaier tonight at 6PM. #Trump2016
664911913831301123 Macy's was very disloyal to me bc of my strong stance on illegal immigration. Their stock has crashed! #BoycottMacys
664906279249420292 Thank you @Forbes for showing the @WSJ was wrong. So dishonest!
664905002788458496 From 2% to 27% in Texas - quite a jump into first place!
664885790061813760 Wow, pres. candidate Ben Carson, who is very weak on illegal Immigration, just said he likes amnesty and a pathway to citizenship.
664882878296276993 Total fool @KarlRove is part of the Republican Establishment problem. An all talk, no action dummy!
664850952319553536 @WSJ and dopey Karl Rove made a mistake and purposely mischaracterized my statement on the terrible TPP deal.
664821989996150784 Why does the failing @WSJ write a false editorial about me and let dummy @KarlRove make the same mistake in the same edition of the paper?
664820082325893121 @KarlRove is a biased dope who wrote falsely about me re China and TPP. This moron wasted $430 million on political campaigns and lost 100%
664787273184108545 We, as a country, either have borders or we don't. IF WE DON'T HAVE BORDERS, WE DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY!
664780488436031489 Why wouldn't the @WSJ call for comment or clarification before writing an editorial which is so totally wrong. No wonder it is doing poorly!
664772537327448064 When and how are the dummies at the @WSJ going to apologize to me for their totally incorrect Editorial on me. I want smart trade deals.
664771064988332032 The @WSJ Editorial Board is so wrong, so often. They got info from an incorrect story in another pub. Why not watch and listen to debate.
664769890604175361 @WSJ Editorial Board should review my debate statement re China and T.P.P. and apologize. China not part but will get their way in later.
664768772683776000 Today's @WSJ Editorial is WRONG again. I know that China is not in the new T.P.P. trade deal but would come in latter through a back door.
664765650003333120 I will be interviewed on @MariaBartiromo @FoxBusiness at 7:30
664763701845745664 All seven on-line polls, including Drudge and Time, with thousands of respondents, said I won the debate. @krauthammer said I was so, so.
664581400721494017 Will be interviewed by @oreillyfactor tonight at 8 PM.
664579276436541440 I will be on @marklevinshow at 8PM tonight. Tune in!
664578984693354498 @gerardtbaker GerardÃ¢wonderful job last night as moderator of the debate. I told many, really smart and elegant.
664578302447902720 I never said that China was in the bad TPP trade deal but that China would come in the back door at a later date. @CNN @FoxBusiness
664481865559068672 Just returned home from the great state of New Hampshire. Have made so many friends there--special place!
664481432174264320 Happy Veterans Day. To those who have served, thank you for your special work.
664469852149665792 Thank you @Morning_Joe & @morningmika -- a great show! #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
664394692180733952 Loved doing the debate...won Drudge and all on-line polls! Amazing evening, moderators did an outstanding job.
664393836161064960 Will be on @Morning_Joe live from New Hampshire - 7:00 A.M. Talking about the debate and more!
664336037607546880 I will be on @Morning_Joe live from New Hampshire tomorrow at 7am. #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

664047664607178752 I will be interviewed by @GStephanopoulos on @GMA at 7:00 A.M. There is much to talk about!
663929989319012352 Thank you to @NYPost's Robert Rorke for the really nice review of #SNL. So many enjoyed it - very gratifying!
663923846949548032 Marco Rubio is totally weak on illegal immigration & in favor of easy amnesty. A lightweight choker - bad for #USA!
663923439120596993 Marco Rubio couldn't even respond properly to President Obama's State of the Union Speech without pouring sweat & chugging water. He choked!
663922928766091264 Marco Rubio is a total lightweight who I wouldn't hire to run one of my smaller companies - a highly overrated politician!
663919402367262720 A great evening in Springfield, Illinois. Thank you for all of the support! #Trump2016
663875531163746305 Great job on @Greta @DonaldJTrumpJr. Nobody could have done it better!
663819248033275908 Thanks Piers. Greatly appreciated. @piersmorgan
663809154922991620 @CNN should listen. Ana Navarro has no talent, no TV persona, and works for BushÃ¢a total conflict of interest.
663779118761312256 @Betsy_McCaughey Thanks so much. Really appreciate your comments. I will help the veterans like no one else.
663518286915702784 Thank you to all of those who gave me such wonderful reviews for my performance on @nbcsnl Saturday Night Live. Best ratings in 4 years!
663480514108653568 @EricShawnonFox Highest rated Saturday Night Live in four years. 47% higher than their opening night with Hillary & Miley Cyrus. Nice words
663384887521624064 Television ratings for @nbcsnl Saturday Night Live just came out and they were great - the best since 2011. Very few protesters!
663361401935765504 At 10:30 I will be interviewed on both @meetthepress by @chucktodd and @CBSNews Face The Nation by John Dickerson. This after long evening!
663359644681785344 I will be interviewed by @GStephanopoulos on @ABC at 10:00 A.M.
663350402931380224 @CNN Will be interviewed by Jake Tapper at 9:00 A.M. Enjoy.
663345007072530432 @nbcsnl - So much fun last night!
663329293754351616 Will be on @foxandfriends at 8:00 A.M.
663328941818671104 Amazing evening at Saturday Night Live!
663148211759136768 I am at the Saturday Night Live Studio - electricity all over the place. We will be doing a tweeting skit, so stay tuned!
663050261431246848 They are saying that tickets to tonight's Saturday Night Live are the hardest to get in the history of this great show! Off to a good start!
663046966180474880 Saturday Night Live has some incredible things in store tonight. The great thing about playing myself is that it will be authentic! Enjoy
663045546781855748 @RobertGBeckel Please thank your brother for his nice words on television. Seems like a great guy and character! @CNN
662862145974108160 One of the dumbest political pundits on television is Chris Stirewalt of @FoxNews. Wrong facts - check Fox debate rankings, Trump #1. Dope!
662783390538665984 Would be nice if @jmartNYT learned how to read the polls before writing his next story. Probably done on purpose, but not good reporting!
662780151122550784 @BillKristol has become a sad case. His magazine is failing badly, probably doesn't have long to go, and his predictions are always wrong!
662721166356840448 Will be on @oreillyfactor tonight. Signing a copy of Crippled America for Bill!
662717972981551104 So sad that Obama rejected Keystone Pipeline. Thousands of jobs, good for the environment, no downside!
662714441121726465 Happy Birthday to the great @BillyGraham. He's done so many wonderful things, not the least of which is his fantastic family. I love Billy!
662682056590237696 Getting ready for @nbcsnl commercial.
662647206357442560 @AJDelgado13 Thank you so much for the nice words and support--really enjoy listening to your ideas and thoughts.
662642742628085760 I think it would be a good ideaÃ¢and fairÃ¢to include @GovChristie & @MikeHuckabeeGOP in the debate. Both solid & good guys. @FoxBusiness
662632702227648512 Carson now admits his friend named Bob, who he tried to stab (Bob was saved by his belt buckle!), no longer exists as Bob. Wrong name!
662632599962173440 With Ben Carson wanting to hit his mother on head with a hammer, stab a friend and Pyramids built for grain storage - don't people get it?
662604464830988288 Such bad reporting: A puff piece on Ben Carson in the @nytimes states that Carson is trying to solidify his lead. But I am #1, easily! Sad
662599915596554240 Florida Ethics Commission Advocate comes down hard on Rubio. So do two people who worked with him. Said he used the wrong credit card! Sure.
662562140511985664 A great honor to easily finish FIRST in the @FoxNews poll tabulation even though some of my best polls were not used in determining winner!
662457431033815040 The Carson story is either a total fabrication or, if true, even worse-trying to hit mother over the head with a hammer or stabbing friend!
662411704979095552 Rubio lied about my meeting w/ Hispanic activists. I didn't change my opinion but treated them w/ respect. Shame!
662196963878809600 @seanhannity should have corrected Jeb Bush when he said that I ran for president twice. Never ran, merely considered running!
662192823282847745 Jeb Bush just said about Marco Rubio, he's my friend! Pure political speak. Why can't he be truthful and say disloyal guy, no friend!
662047905520467968 Also, tune in to the @TodayShow at 7:00am. I will be on to discuss the campaign, my new ads and #CrippledAmerica.
662047688620417024 I will unveil my first campaign ads on @Morning_Joe at 6:30am tomorrow. Enjoy! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
662046407113732096 Wow! @FoxNews poll just came out. #1 with 26%! Almost as importantly, I am the strongest on economic issues by far! #Trump2016
661920335328092160 Just landed in New Hampshire - a very exciting morning planned!
661897728432173056 Isn't it terrible that @megynkelly used a poll not used before (I.B.D.) when I was down, but refuses to use it now when I am up?
661662863023603712 I will be on @SeanHannity tonight at 10pmE talking about my new book #CrippledAmerica and much more! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
661570281060835328 Marco Rubio would keep Barack Obama's executive order on amnesty intact. See article. Cannot be President.
661555742193922050 @CharlesGKoch is looking for a new puppet after Governor Walker and Jeb Bush cratered. He now likes Rubio--next fail.
661541465714253824 Join me today, Nov 3rd, in #TrumpTowerNYC at noon. I'll be signing copies of my new book CRIPPLED AMERICA. Don't miss it!
661499677494390784 I will be interviewed on @GMA at 7:00 A.M. and @foxandfriends at 7:50. Talking about my new book, out today, Crippled America.
661304796188688384 Join me tomorrow, Nov. 3rd, at 12pm in #TrumpTowerNY. I'll be signing copies of my new book CRIPPLED AMERICA. Don't miss it!
661297234789711874 My interview with @jheil & @MarkHalperin at @WollmanRink airing at 5PM on @bpolitics.
661249199170801664 @megynkelly used this poll (nobody else did) when I was downÃ¢wonder if she'll use it now that I'm up?
661246862029160449 @CharlesMBlow Why don't you use new polls instead of the single ancient national poll that was a tiny bit negative. Dishonest reporting!
661212929560322050 Meet me at @TrumpTowerNY and get your copy of my new book CRIPPLED AMERICA signed on 11/3 at 12pm!
661173906758352900 Thank you Carl Higbie (former Navy Seal) for you support of my plan to straighten out the Veterans Administration-a mess!Great job @kilmeade
661156823723036672 @Morning_Joe: Marco only won the debate in the minds of desperate people. I won every on-line poll, even crazy @CNBC. Marco good looking?
661146467504152576 Sirius National News at 7:30 A.M. Steve Bannon. @BreitbartNews
661004204962656256 Now that Iran ripped us off by making one of the best deals of any kind in history, they have just moved to block any imports from the U.S.
660998499153092608 Thank you @JoeTrippi for the nice, and true, words on #Media Buzz with terrific Howie Kurtz. Leading New Hampshire 30 to 12. @FoxNews
660969740236623872 While in politics it is often smart to send out false messages, one thing is clear: That Hillary does not want to run against TRUMP.
660888538473439232 Join me Tuesday Nov. 3rd at 12 PM in #TrumpTower in NYC. I'll be signing copies of my book CRIPPLED AMERICA. Don't miss it!
660819552259989504 If Jeb Bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with Marco in the debate. BAD facts for Marco if properly delivered!
660818201765392384 Marco Rubio will not win. Weak on illegal immigration, strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a lightweight.
660816598333333504 I told you in speeches months ago that Jeb and Marco do not like each other. Marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to Jeb as his mentor!
660815666199592960 Jeb's new slogan - Jeb can fix it. I never thought of Jeb as a crook! Stupid message, the word fix is not a good one to use in politics!
660798628315930625 Anybody that believes in strong borders and stopping illegal immigration cannot vote for Marco Rubio READ THIS:
660795917973499904 Further proof that Gang of Eight member Marco Rubio is weak on illegal immigration is Paul Singer's, Mr. Amnesty, endorsement.Rubs can't win
660645187874590720 Gov. John Kasich has really failed on the campaign trail. I thought he would have been far more talented. He is just wasting time & money!
660597552023228416 @thehill John Oliver had his people call to ask me to be on his very boring and low rated show. I said NO THANKS Waste of time & energy!
660595546168627200 Few people know that @FortuneMagazine is still in business. Tell your writer Alisa Soloman that I left The Apprentice to run for president
660584908063117312 No complaints but how many people would be watching these really dumb but record setting debates if I wasn't in them? Interesting question!
660583102792769536 Thank you James Freeman of the @WSJ for the very nice words. All polls said I won the debate except NBC (3rd). Explain to Daniel Henninger!
660536151225315328 Support Coach Kennedy and his right, together with his young players, to pray on the football field. Liberty Institute just suspended him!
660534676851974144 Just left Virginia where I unveiled my healthcare and other plans for our great Veterans! They will be very happy!
660534094493782016 @ColinCowherd said such nice things about me during the debate that I thought I'd do his show, @TheHerd, on Monday (2:30pm EST).
660460909761069057 The @WSJ Wall Street Journal loves to write badly about me. They better be careful or I will unleash big time on them. Look forward to it!
660458917005279232 Lifting off right now for U.S.S. Wisconsin in Norfolk. See ya'
660453193806159872 I told you so-@politico just lost it's top person. Poor results and no money to pay him. If they were legit, they would be doing far better!
660433250423341057 I am leaving for Norfolk, Virginia - the great battleship U.S.S. Wisconsin - for a big rally and really big crowd. See you soon!
660431840776470528 I see Marco Rubio just landed another billionaire to give big money to his Superpac, which are total scams. Marco must address him as SIR!
660430666727821312 The new NBC POLL has me in first place but said I was third in the debate - I demand a recount (just kidding!). EVERY other poll had me #1.

659392248589627392 Does anybody think that @CNBC will get their fictitious polling numbers corrected sometime prior to the start of the debate. Sad!
659388840709259264 @Morning_Joe can you believe Kasie Hunt's poor and purposely inaccurate reporting on my great night and crowd in Iowa. @politico is a scam!
659384553023254528 @CNBC continues to report fictious poll numbers. Number one, based on every statistic, is Trump (by a wide margin). They just can't say it!

645762321755807744 I have been leading big in all polls, with two more today, @nbc and @CNN. The NBC poll is more than double next, at 29%. Fiorina has 11%.
645756861224980480 There is no way that Carly Fiorina can become the Republican Nominee or win against the Dems. Boxer killed her for Senate in California!
645587580059123713 I will be on @meetthepress at 10:30. @nbc will be releasing their new poll numbers. Based on the debate results, I should do well-who knows?
645415231028641792 Thank you Faith and Freedom Forum & @UrbandaleSchool. I had a great time in Iowa today!
645399286621044736 A great night in Iowa!
645315215643516928 On my way to Iowa. Will be landing in Des Moines in two hours. See ya!
645230169997881344 Christians need support in our country (and around the world), their religious liberty is at stake! Obama has been horrible, I will be great
645225684328165376 If I would have challenged the man, the media would have accused me of interfering with that man's right of free speech. A no win situation!
645220326960443392 If someone made a nasty or controversial statement about me to the president, do you really think he would come to my rescue? No chance!
645218898632146944 This is the first time in my life that I have caused controversy by NOT saying something.
645217260311855104 Am I morally obligated to defend the president every time somebody says something bad or controversial about him? I don't think so!
644982107266265088 Looking forward to meeting the students of Urbandale High School tomorrow-
644980879878713344 I've just released my position papers on The Second Amendment.

644932926354927616 Wow, great post-debate poll: Trump Increases Lead via Breitbart
644596892698050560 Would be really bad if columnist Mike Lupica left the @NYDailyNews. A wonderful and talented guy!
644594974542176256 Will be interviewed tonight by @seanhannity on @FoxNews at 10 PM. Enjoy!
644563708270780416 Going to New Hampshire in a little while. Big crowds! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!
644561043402944512 Every poll done on debate last night, from Drudge to Newsmax to Time Magazine, had me winning in a landslide. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!
644560712665329664 Just announced that in the history of @CNN, last night's debate was its highest rated ever. Will they send me flowers & a thank you note?
644358678431334400 The #CNNDebate was amazing --- so much fun!
644356882174476288 #CNNDebate Winning the @drudge_report poll-
644247464053047296 Thank you to Tom Brady, Coach Ditka, Coach Bobby Knight and all of the many champions that have been so supportive!
644241866834055168 A great honor from somebody that knows how to win!
644240321920958464 Will be heading over to the debate soon. Can you believe @CNN is milking it for almost 3 hours? Too long, too many people on stage!
643987188489699328 I hope Arnold S. does well with the Apprentice because he is a nice guy and also, because I get a big percentage of the profits!
643977361021493248 Just finished the wonderful event on the U.S.S. Iowa. VETERANS FOR A STRONG AMERICA endorsed me. Such a great honor, thank you!
643856676236460032 @rushlimbaugh Rush, I am in LA inspecting property (big job creator) & listening to you. You are truly fantastic--thanks!
643846888387649536 The polls are really looking goodÃ¢#1 everywhere despite all lobbyist & special interest $ being spent against me. I'm turning down millions.
643844995892555777 Everyone is talking about the incredible event we had in Dallas last night. Spectacular crowd & arena! Thank you @mcuban.
643843692588081152 @club4growth asked me for $1 million. I said no. Now falsely advertising that I will raise taxes. I'll lower big league for middle class.
643843401037819904 My plan will lower taxes for our country, not raise them. Phony @club4growth says I will raise taxesÃ¢just another lie.
643805331781349377 Little respected Club For Growth asked me for $1,000,000 - I said NO. Now they are spending lobbyist and special interest money on ads!
643801331723956224 Am now in L.A. Will be going to the U.S.S. IOWA at 5:30 P.M. to speak to our great VETERANS and other friends!
643796377781293056 Our vets are treated like 3rd class citizens. Enough! Join me & @V4SA on @USSIOWA at LA Waterfront to hear my plan for vets & the military!
643794390666735616 Loved Dallas and the tremendous crowd last night. Will be back!
643768825117282304 I will rebuild the military, take care of vets and make the world respect the US again! Join me today. Info:
643649653079040000 Speech in Dallas went really well. Big and wonderful crowd. Just arrived in L.A. Big day tomorrow!
643606033156452352 Unbelievable crowd in Dallas!
643523615980421120 Vets mistreated, NO border security? I'm with @V4SA this Tuesday 9/15 to #MakeAmericasMilitaryGreatAgain! Join us!
643511476892909568 The event with me and @V4SA in L.A on 9/15 is turning out to be huge. Get your tickets before they're gone
643511144150376449 Looking forward to joining @V4SA Tuesday 9/15 in L.A. aboard the @USSIowa - The Battleship of Presidents! Join us!
643490309322752000 My opponents big bosses--lobbyists and donors--are trying to do damage. They will fail! Money down the drain!
643467411283386368 Thanks Mark, will be fun.
643464202527633408 To all my fans, sorry I couldn't do The Apprentice any longerÃ¢but equal time (presidential run) prohibits me from doing so. Love!
643464030749859840 Congrats to my friend @Schwarzenegger who is doing next season's Celebrity Apprentice. He'll be great & will raise lots of $ for charity.
643445473001480192 My honor, thank you.
643056922308939776 Why is someone like George Pataki, who did a terrible job as Governor of N.Y. and registers ZERO in the polls, allowed on the debate stage?
642803259548278785 Had a record crowd in Boone, Iowa. A fantastic day--- we will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
642802749420216320 I am having a great time in Iowa at Jack Trice Stadium! Unbelievable people.
642790262532612096 Too many people on stage for debate. @RandPaul at 11th, with 2% in @RealClearNews, shouldn't be allowed to participate.
642788935530344448 I truly understood the appeal of Ron Paul, but his son, @RandPaul, didn't get the right gene.
642788749030608896 Lightweight Senator @RandPaul should focus on trying to get elected in Kentucky--- a great state which is embarrassed by him.
642729073211523072 Donald Trump Sends @FallonTonight to Highest Friday Rating in 18 Months. @JimmyFallon, that is #HUGE!

642388318139904001 @robertjeffress I greatly appreciate your kind words last night on @FoxNews. Have great love for the evangelicals -- great respect for you.
642359714265874432 Just purchased NBC's half of The Miss Universe Organization and settled all lawsuits against them. Now own 100% -- stay tuned!
642356689254129666 Let's all take a moment to remember all of the heroes from a very tragic day that we cannot let happen again!
642324754188398592 Oh wow, lightweight Governor @BobbyJindal, who is registered at less than 1 percent in the polls, just mocked my hair. So original!
642319147611910145 Also, tomorrow night I will be going to Boone and Ames. Really look forward to seeing all of my friends in Iowa.
642319012249096192 Very good newsÃ¢the new Quinnipiac poll just came outÃ¢I am #1 in Iowa.
642317163156635648 I will be on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon tonight at 11:30. Should be fun! @jimmyfallon
642082978861031424 .... I only respond to people that register more than 1% in the polls. I never thought he had a chance and I've been proven right.
642082898414305280 Bobby Jindal did not make the debate stage and therefore I have never met himÃ¢Â¦.
642034325404446720 I'll be on @greta ON THE RECORD tonight at 7 PM
641773826167177217 Wow, I am ahead of the field with Evangelicals (am so proud of this) and virtually every other group, and Ben Carson just took a swipe at me
641770394773520384 I had a great day in D.C. even though the subject was an unpleasant one, the horrible Iran Nuke deal. Amazing crowd and enthusiasm!
641699209561907202 Man did JEB throw his brother under the bus last night on @colbertlateshow . Probably true, but not nice!
641665721097945092 I will be speaking at the #StopIranDeal rally shortly- watch live here-
641620129051246592 A letter to @CNN President Jeff Zucker-
641451815687602176 See you in D.C. tomorrow at 1:00 P.M. at the Capitol to protest the horribly negotiated deal with Iran. Really sad!
641392516403695616 Via @USATODAY- Amateur hour with the Iran nuclear deal
641367321269768192 Will be on Bill O'Reilly @oreillyfactor tonight at 8 PM. Enjoy!
641360526446956545 A great honor to receive polling numbers like these. Record setting African American (25%) & Hispanic numbers (31%).
641339495099465728 I'm on Bill @oreillyfactor tonight at 8 PM. It will be another lively interview about how to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!
641336409484316673 Jeb's policies in Florida helped lead to its almost total collapse. Right after he left he went to work for Lehman BrothersÃ¢wow!
641335666178158593 The lobbyists & special interests have just put out an ad for Jeb which hits me just a little but is very false!
641335522447753216 I'm self funding my campaign but lobbyists & special interests for Jeb & others are starting to do big adsÃ¢desperate! Don't believe them.
641323960949452800 Wake up Jeb supporters!
641305884463861761 Thank you @IngrahamAngle for your strength & wonderful words last night on @FoxNews, but @KarlRove is easy to beat!
641277106052300800 Wow! Such nice words from Robert Redford on my running for President. Thank you, Robert.
641270970607603713 Tomorrow in DC: 1 PM West Front Lawn of the Capitol. Not even believable that we would do this deal with Iran.
641270480209620992 Look forward to being in DC tomorrowÃ¢big crowd expected for our protest against the truly stupid nuclear deal we are making with Iran.
640984209042112512 Looking forward to being with @SenTedCruz at our big rally in D.C. on Wednesday (1:00 P.M. at the Capitol) to protest insane Iran nuke deal!
640971682820300800 Both Washington D.C. and DALLAS are turning out to be really big events. D.C. is protest of incompetent Iran deal and Dallas is big speech!
640970241879732224 Remember, I'll see you in D.C. at the Capitol Building on Wednesday at 1:00 o'clock. Then Dallas on Sept.14 at 6:00 P.M. American Air Center
640963980069105665 Thank you @scottienhughes for your powerful words on @FoxNews. I am with the Evangelicals and Tea Party big time. We will all WIN together!
640682985176567808 @club4growth should release the letter they sent me asking for $1,000,000. When I said no, they came out against me. A scam operation?
640624897601982464 I will be in Washington D.C. on Wednesday,1 P.M.,in front of the Capitol, to protest the horrible and incompetent deal being made with Iran.
640622504097284096 The Dallas event on September 14 at 6:00 P.M. at the American Airlines Center looks like it will be a giant success. Tickets are going FAST!
640621490107490304 Our country needs a president with great leadership skills and vision, not someone like Hillary or Barack, neither of which has a clue!
640618399740116992 The phony Club For Growth, which asked me in writing for $1,000,000 (I said no), is now wanting to do negative ads on me. Total hypocrites!
640485528115277824 If the presidential election were held today, according to this @surveyusa poll, Donald Trump would defeat any Dem:
640281925270286336 The hedge fund guys (gals) have to pay higher taxes ASAP. They are paying practically nothing. We must reduce taxes for the middle class!
640280850182090752 By self-funding my campaign, I am not controlled by my donors, special interests or lobbyists. I am only working for the people of the U.S.!
640279939061841920 Remember that I am self-funding my campaign. Hillary, Jeb and the rest are spending special interest and lobbyist money.100% CONTROLLED
640278865584197633 Hillary said such nasty things about me, read directly off her teleprompter...but there was no emotion, no truth. Just can't read speeches!
640277396785119232 Hillary Clinton made a speech today using the biggest teleprompter I have ever seen. In fact, it wasn't even see through glass, it was black
640276587372519424 Saudi Arabia was vehemently against the Iran nuclear deal. Then today they embraced it. What happened? What did we give them to endorse?
640139404829401088 Just announced that because of Trump, advertising rates for debate on @CNN are going from $5000 to $200,000, a 4000% increase.PAY CHARITY?
640137467014852608 Why would a very low ratings radio talk show host like Hugh Hewitt be doing the next debate on @CNN. He is just a 3rd rate gotcha guy!
640135836294623232 Very low ratings radio host Hugh Hewitt asked me about Suleiman, Abu Bake al-Baghdad, Hassan Nasrallah and more - typical gotcha questions
640133656393195520 The Dallas event in two weeks, at the American Airlines Center, is filling up fast. Get your tickets fast, before it is too late!
640131477179645952 @MeghanMcCain was terrible on @TheFive yesterday. Angry and obnoxious, she will never make it on T.V. @FoxNews can do so much better!
639871678164692992 Terrific response to my previous tweet: I'll be in Dallas at the American Airlines Center on Sept 14th at 6 PM. Ã¢Â¦
639851035520040960 So nice, thank you Laura.

639480265841225729 Congratulations to Tom Brady on yet another great victory- Tom is my friend and a total winner!
639265404121141248 The deal with Iran will go down as one of the most incompetent ever made. The U.S. lost on virtually every point. We just don't win anymore!
639257553914994688 @brithume, I am in first place by a lot in all polls, tied for first place with Ben Carson in one Iowa poll. I thought you knew this-thanks

639155923991330816 @kevinolearytv Great job on @foxandfriends this morning. You tell it like it is! Also, thx for the nice mention. Your book sounds great!
639140140389167105 A terrible deal with Iran!
639021108302356480 Will be interviewed on @GMA this morning at 7:00. Thanks for the GREAT poll results!
638897909501702144 When I intelligently turned down The Club For Growth crazy request for $1,000,000, they got nasty.What a waste of money that would have been
638895586628997120 The president of the pathetic Club For Growth came to my office in N.Y.C. and asked for a ridiculous $1,000,000 contribution. I said no way!
638887827871244288 Every Poll has me winning BIG.If you listen to dopey Karl Rove, a Trump hater, on @oreillyfactor, you would think I'm doing poorly. @FoxNews
638876473668014080 Why does @oreillyfactor and @FoxNews always have Karl Rove on. He spent $430 million and lost ALL races. A dope who said Romney won election
638805379745456128 I'm turning down millions of dollars of campaign contributionsÃ¢feel totally stupid doing so, but hope it is appreciated by the voters.
638804903083778048 Many Super Pacs, funded by groups that want total control over their candidate, are being formed to attack Trump. Remember when u see them
638795082154549248 No more Clintons or Bushes!
638783663715536896 Congrats everyone--we topped 4 million today on Twitter--and heading up fast!
638742443685494784 While millions are being spent against me in attack ads, they are paid for by the bosses and owners of candidates. I am self funding.
638742292707323904 Jeb is spending millions of dollars on hit ads funded by lobbyists & special interests. Bad system.
638742241989820416 Yet another weak hit by a candidate with a failing campaign. Will Jeb sink as low in the polls as the others who have gone after me?
638647394020757504 The just released Public Policy Polling (PPP - national result) is the best yet. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
638533114864791552 Just out - new PPP NATIONAL POLL has me in first place by a wide margin at 29%. I wonder why only @FoxNews has not reported this? Too bad!
638512537433149440 150 Clinton E-mails still contain classified information. More sensitive when she was Sec.of State. This is a very big deal.
638511155582005248 President Obama wants to change the name of Mt. McKinley to Denali after more than 100 years. Great insult to Ohio. I will change back!
638439811897008128 Very proud of Trump Int'l Golf Links in Aberdeen, Scotland. Just got the five star award from @VisitScotNews
638415514402975744 See, I told you so
638386619133882368 This is no act of love as Jeb Bush saidÃ¢Â¦
638367095424712704 For those that don't think a wall (fence) works, why don't they suggest taking down the fence around the White House? Foolish people!
638318502059880450 Huma Abedin, the top aide to Hillary Clinton and the wife of perv sleazebag Anthony Wiener, was a major security risk as a collector of info
638298477441732608 Leading in the Bloomberg Iowa poll. Also, my favorability numbers went up at a record, almost unheard of, clip. Thank you Iowa!
638297160992358400 Loved being with my many friends in Tennessee. The crowd and enthusiasm was fantastic. I won the straw poll big!

637605742040756224 Great rally last night in Massachusetts. 2000 people at a house - must be a record! Unbelievable spirit to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.

637056664886202368 Will be interviewed on @Morning_Joe at 7:00 A.M. So much to talk about!
637028810865688578 Who wants the endorsement of a guy (@EricCantor) who lost in perhaps the greatest upset in the history of Congress?
636907033241997312 @BenFergusonShow just watched you on @CNN. Thank you for your nice comments.
636902595353812993 The press has very inaccurately covered this event - see for yourself!
636740549333098496 Great job on @CNN tonight @heytana. We are all proud of you! Also, congrats on a great son - he is going places.

636252027878789121 Great American heroes who averted an attack in France. THANK YOU! Spencer Stone, Anthony Sadler, & Alex Skarlatos.
636174308264550400 Another good poll result in the great state of SC. Trump at 30%. Carson at 15% and Bush at 9%.
636173679093747713 Congrats @LindseyGrahamSC. You just got 4 points in your home state of SCÃ¢far better than zero nationally. You're only 26 pts behind me.
636158507318943744 @GovernorPataki did a terrible job as Governor of New York. If he ran again, he would have lost in a landslide. He and Graham ZERO in polls
636155822326829056 Jeb Bush just talked about my border proposal to build a fence. It's not a fence, Jeb, it's a WALL, and there's a BIG difference!
636129007164108800 Asians are very offended that JEB said that anchor babies applies to them as a way to be more politically correct to hispanics. A mess!
636128157788192768 In a clumsy move to get out of his anchor babies dilemma, where he signed that he would not use the term and now uses it, he blamed ASIANS
636009387916705792 Jeb Bush never uses his last name on advertising, signage, materials etc. Is he ashamed of the name BUSH? A pretty sad situation. Go Jeb!
635992616748904448 I liked The Kelly File much better without @megynkelly. Perhaps she could take another eleven day unscheduled vacation!
635990651738419200 @megynkelly must have had a terrible vacation, she is really off her game. Was afraid to confront Dr. Cornel West. No clue on immigration!

635829918199324672 Depression- be careful of China!
635809588567257088 Markets are crashing - all caused by poor planning and allowing China and Asia to dictate the agenda. This could get very messy! Vote Trump.
635806464595116032 As I have long stated, we are so tied in with China and Asia that their markets are now taking the U.S. market down. Get smart U.S.A.
635406457308057600 New Reuters Poll just came out and has me at 32%, highest number yet.The silent majority is back and we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
635401058123059201 The last thing we need is another Bush in the White House. Would be the same old thing (remember read my lips, no more taxes). GREATNESS!
635216782794596352 Jeb Bush has a photoshopped photo for an ad which gives him a black left hand and much different looking body. Jeb just can't get it right!
635214634627256320 Jeb Bush is weak on illegal immigration, in favor of common core, bad on women's health issues and thinks the Iraq war was a good thing.
635200284290105344 Now that I started my war on illegal immigration and securing the border, most other candidates are finally speaking up. Just politicians!
635186889314672641 It has just been confirmed by the City of Mobile, Alabama, that there were 30,000 people at last nights event, making it #1for pol season.

635184411399618561 Thank you to the @washingtonpost for the accurate and very discriptive story on my speech in Alabama last night. It was a great evening!
635182993334792193 I had 15,000 people in Phoenix but @politico said the rooms capacity is just over 2000. But said Bernie Sanders had 11,000 in same room.
635175769069723648 @politico covers me more inaccurately than any other media source, and that is saying something. They go out of their way to distort truth!
635058369431252992 Alabama was great last night, amazing people. 30,000 folks was largest crowd of political season. Nice!

634725641972248576 How crazy - 7.5% of all births in U.S. are to illegal immigrants, over 300,000 babies per year. This must stop. Unaffordable and not right!
634724114972966912 Jeb Bush signed memo saying not to use the term anchor babies, offensive. Now he wants to use it because I use it. Stay true to yourself!
634591629744152576 Alabama will shine tomorrow. It will be a big and glorious day!

630907466008653824 Why is @RandPaul allowed to take advantage of the people of Kentucky by running for Senator and Pres. Why should Kentucky be back up plan?
630906211790102528 We must stop the crime and killing machine that is illegal immigration. Rampant problems will only get worse. Take back our country!
630901938608017413 Truly weird Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky reminds me of a spoiled brat without a properly functioning brain. He was terrible at DEBATE!

630100913861099520 Wow, CNN just said that Donald Trump won the DEBATE, connected best with audience. Also, Time, Drudge, Newsmax, N.Y.Times and more!

527385975128068096 The U.S. rocket that blew-up and crashed yesterday is emblematic of the United States under Obama. Nothing works, be it a rocket or website.
527247723196862464 President Obama strongly considering a plan to bring non-U.S. citizens with Ebola to the United States for treatment. Now I know he's nuts!

525635174877630464 The Ebola doctor who just flew to N.Y. from West Africa and went on the subway, bowling and dining is a very SELFISH man-should have known!
525499546689077249 President Obama, you are a complete and total disaster, but you have a chance to do something great and important: STOP THE FLIGHTS!
525495434928988160 President Obama has a major meeting on the N.Y.C. Ebola outbreak, with people flying in from all over the country, but decided to play golf!
525492766366007296 I never thought I'd say it in my lifetime, but President Barack Hussein Obama, aka Barry Sotoro, is a far worse president than Jimmy Carter!
525474609710510080 I have been saying for weeks for President Obama to stop the flights from West Africa. So simple, but he refused. A TOTAL incompetent!
525472979443273728 Ebola has been confirmed in N.Y.C., with officials frantically trying to find all of the people and things he had contact with.Obama's fault
525431218910027776 If this doctor, who so recklessly flew into New York from West Africa,has Ebola,then Obama should apologize to the American people & resign!
525427584717578241 There is a good possibility that a person who treated patients in West Africa and who FLEW into New York has Ebola. Touched many, bedlam!

524836291964575744 If there is one more Ebola case in the U.S., a full travel ban will be instituted. This common sense move should have been done long ago!
524708583150456832 The United States troops which were sent to West Africa have only gotten 4 hours of Ebola training - very unfair to them and their families!
524707073649827840 The United States, under President Obama, has truly become the gang that couldn't shoot straight. Everything he touches turns to garbage!
524705334485843968 The U.S. accidentally air dropped a large shipment of military weapons and supplies right into the middle of ISIS as enemy laughs! Very sad!

523785899264712705 Do you believe Obama just said that America would be less safe with a travel ban from West Africa.This is the thinking of a total mad man!
523783171293601792 The lobbyist and political hack that President Obama just appointed as the Ebola Czar, just missed his first major meeting on Ebola-A joke

522664117438775296 I am starting to think that there is something seriously wrong with President Obama's mental health. Why won't he stop the flights. Psycho!
522662342652616704 It is time for the airline pilots, flight attendants and the airlines themselves to stop flights to and from West Africa. Do it right now!
522544210759909376 I just had a great victory against lightweight A.G. Eric Schneiderman. Most of his case re Trump U. was thrown out or gutted. Little remains

482089006104973312 Now Syria is bombing Iraq and Secy. Kerry, after we blew the hell out of the place, says please don't do that. Syria is a front for Iran.

481512106886709248 Another cover-up. Obama won't disclose how many illegal immigrants he has released into our country No surprise.
481491698607202304 The 9.11.12 attack on the Benghazi consulate was a sophisticated, multi-prong wave attack. When will all the 50+ fighters face justice?
481490652031897600 The Benghazi terrorist is getting speedier care than our Vets at the VA. Obama has his priorities.
481476418879365121 A @senatormcdaniel win is a victory for our country. Chris is a Constitutional Conservative who'll make a difference in Washington.

481123789674393600 The failing @NYDailyNews which just raised its prices because it's dying, said I wear a wig when they know I don't. Dishonest.
481123689644457984 The dying @NYDailyNews asked me to do an Editorial on the Central Park 5 ripoff & then they pretend it was my idea. Loser newspaper!
481110978990313473 I wonder if when Secy. Kerry goes to Iraq and Afghanistan he pushes hard for them to look at GLOBAL WARMING and study the carbon footprint?
481108848892051456 Do you believe that Secy. KERRY just went to Egypt to talk about human rights problems and this as everything is being blown up around him
481064064869613569 @Graeme_McDowell Great playing Graeme - you are a true champion!
481026374170210304 I will be on Fox & Friends at 7 A.M. - 10 minutes. Much to talk about, enjoy!
480672486342664193 I'd bet the lawyers for the Central Park 5 are laughing at the stupidity of N.Y.C. when there was such a strong case against their clients
480670583613435904 How much money are the lawyers for the Central Park Five getting out of the 40 million dollars, or are they paid by the City (or both)?
480668639201198080 N.Y. City is paying FORTY MILLION DOLLARS to five men that many think are guilty as hell. So many facts - should have been trial. Politics!
480624342623993856 I loved the day Paul Goldberger got fired (or left) as N.Y.Times architecture critic and has since faded into irrelevance. Kamin next!

479644554803810304 A country that cannot protect its borders is a country destined to fail. Another broken promise by our leaders in Washington.

478588835333681152 If anybody else but Coore and Crenshaw designed Pinehurst they would be run out of townÃ¢(and the turtleback greens are totally unfair)!
478588692085604352 The only reason I am critical of the Pinehurst look is because I'm a lover of golfÃ¢and that look on TV hurts golf badly.

478335432799711232 @MattGinellaGC Matt, how many club championships have you won? I hear zero, or 18 fewer than me! Lets play for a lot?
478330317405564929 @MattGinellaGC Matt, you know nothing about quality golf or what it takes to make golf successful. You are all talk, no substance!
478321197982031872 @MattGinellaGCSadly Matt, you don't understand golf (even though you think you do).I have numerous couses that are far superior to Pinehurst
478319818563543042 @MattGinellaGC I have watched Open Championships at Turnberry, one of the great golf courses of the World. Pinehurst not in the same league
478318847246614528 @MattGinellaGC My position on Pinehurst is correct - bad for the game, a dried out cow pasture. You have no clue but keep trying!
478315769457938433 Johnny Miller correctly very critical of greens at Pinehurst. Said they should be redone
478307098607247361 I'd bet the horrible look of Pinehurst translates into poor television ratings. This is not what golf is about!
478300742348836864 @GolfDigestMag Big news from Scotland on Turnberry (which, by the way, blows Pinehurst away!) tomorrow morning. Stay tuned.
478133865748660224 @HollySandersGC. Remember, it was Martin K who sank the big ten footer to win the Ryder Cup. He can handle the pressure!

478007830889656320 @BlairKamin Blair, you may be the worst architectural critic in the business but thanks for your nice reviews about Trump Chicago & sign PR
478000954080768000 @MattGinellaGC Have you ever seen Trump National/Bedminster or Trump International Golf links in Scotland. Both far better than Pinehurst!
477998629954023424 @MattGinellaGC Matt, the statement about Pinehurst looking like a local community golf course,awful, was not made by me but tweeted to me
477996265897463808 @MattGinellaGC It's true Matt, the NEW Blue Monster is better than Pinehurst, so is Bedminster. Turnberry & Trump Aberdeen blow it away!
477966238333693952 I have been very consistent and always said that Iraq would fall as soon as the U.S. left. What a terrible waste of lives and money!
477962884979257344 Iran will convince our incompetent President that they are trying to help us with Iraq, take over the country & oil, and O will say thanks
477961085555724288 Turnberry in Scotland is a far superior golf course to Pinehurst - and it isn't even close! Likewise the Blue Monster at Doral.
477952992541278208 Iran is moving troops into Iraq under the guise that it is helping out. Actually, they will take over Iraq and all of their oil. Stupid U.S.
477542311115915264 If you want to be successful in business, you must take risks. Make sure each risk is calculated and can have a positive fallback.

477121478866251777 Dopey @chicagotribune critic fails to mention the ugly Sun Times sign.
477121438994804736 Before I bought the site, the Sun Times had the biggest, ugliest sign Chicago has ever seen. Mine is magnificent and popular.

477091784754225152 People are LOVING the Trump sign on the Chicago building. Big league tweets, letters and callsÃ¢Â¦
477091690608873472 A third rate architecture critic--who I thought got firedÃ¢for the failing @chicagotribune likes the building but doesn't like the Trump sign
477059623979986944 I told all of the haters and losers long ago that Iraq would fall, take the OIL or get out fast! Massive waste of lives and trillions of $'s
477058640978120704 Iraq told us to get out, Iraq is now falling, and Iraq now wants us to come back! Don't do it unless we get the OIL, and I mean ALL OF IT!
476899786063228928 Iraq is falling apart fast - two trillion dollars and so many deaths - Bush got us in and Obama took far too long to get us out!
476834775718576128 Someone just asked me, who is my favorite Donald Trump impersonator?

377743129992261632 The only reason Obama gave a speech last night was because it was on the schedule-Putin is laughing and the reviews have been really bad!
377671276258541568 Lightweight Attorney General Eric Schneiderman will be next to lose. He goes after a school with a 98% approval rating,leaves biggies alone
377671162093780992 Lightweight A.G. Eric Schneiderman asked us for political contributions DURING his investigation of us,then sued for $40 million.Dopey guy!
377646458872553473 Thank you to all of my Twitter followers for helping to defeat Weiner and Spitzer. Remember, in the beginning they said it couldn't be done!
377640360983658496 I fought hard against Spitzer and Weiner, and both lost. For a while, when Spitzer was way up, it seemed that I was a lone voice! Good power
377635513051922433 Wow, Eliot Spitzer has lost - great news for New York City!
377605654384742401 Bottom line, I don't think President changed people's minds - must hope for a lifeline from Putin, a very dangerous lifeline at that!
377603764422975488 We will have to see what Russia's next move will be. They may have given him an out of an embarrassing situation or drove into deeper mess!
377601650669932544 He is working hard and for that he must be given credit!
377600416093331456 Doesn't want to remove Assad - worries what comes next.
377599349754433537 Making his case in a nice and articulate manner.
377599059768639488 Does he look sharp, smart and presidential-his hands keep hitting the podium, making a loud and distracting noise-microphone too sensitive.
377592111392366593 Will be covering President Obama's speech at 9.00 on Twitter-you are all so lucky!
377574016808394753 Red line statement was a disaster for President Obama.
377573665296371712 This new Russian strategy guarantees victory for the Syrian government-and makes Obama and U.S. look hopelessly bad. President in trouble!
377569472686850048 The Russians are playing a very smart game. In the meantime they are buying lots of time for Syria and making U.S. look foolish. Dangerous!

376334423069032448 President Obama, do not attack Syria. There is no upside and tremendous downside. Save your powder for another (and more important) day!
376332609150025728 Isn't it intetesting that anybody who attacks President Obama is considered a racist by the real racists out there!
376329798588837888 Speaking of our very stupid war with Iraq, it is totally disintegrating and Iran (with Russia) will walk in and take it over (lots of oil)!
376328560002486272 @lucindamac Thank you, but we are dealing with many very stupid people!
376326101330821120 I'm a Republican but not a fan of the last George Bush-he also was a lousy President (Iraq etc.). In fact, he was so bad he gave us Obama!

376322374377172992 Syria has been given so much time that much of the things we were going to bomb have been moved into civilian areas! A polititian's war.
376321192355184640 Just watching NBC News where our potential attack is being detailed-the exact ships, the stealth bombers, the destinations-so ridiculous!
376114891381542912 If Syria was forced to use Obamacare they would self-destruct without a shot being fired. Obama should sell them that idea!

375967171664707584 I wonder how much our leaders have promised, or given, Russia in order for them to behave and not make the U.S. look even worse?
375965465765769216 Really bad news just announced concerning jobs. Far fewer jobs created in August than anticipated. Interest rates, therefore, to remain low.
375963354097266688 We don't have the leadership, including the Generals (who just said the element of surprise does not matter) to attack anyone! Cool it.
375960370957262848 Did you ever see a situation so ridiculous as our President explaining what, when and where to Congress about a Syrian attack. Far too late!
375759718251503616 The terrorists in Syria are calling themselves REBELS and getting away with it because our leaders are so completely stupid!
375757214763732992 We should not attack Syria but if they make the stupid move to do so, the Arab League,whose members are laughing at us, should pay!

374357806251794432 We have given Syria so much time and information-there has never been such an instance in wartime history. Syria is now fully prepared!
374356124583342080 Why isn't the Arab League paying for everything and sending troops? They want us to do their dirty work with no involvement by themselves!
374354821698318336 The Arab League stated that it wants nothing to do with an attack on Syria, but they want us to attack.Are our leaders insane or just stupid
374123730462851072 It is truly amateur hour at the White House - and this is why we should not be doing the war thing right now!
374121577350463488 President Obama's weakness and indecision may have saved us from doing a horrible and very costly (in more ways than money) attack on Syria!

373747038938480641 Did anyone notice that Obama failed to get a coalition of other countries to go along with us. He couldn't even get Britain! NO LEADERSHIP.
373743492151136256 Be prepared, there is a small chance that our horrendous leadership could unknowingly lead us into World War III.
373742774597992448 China is already preparing to benefit economically from this mess. They will pick up the pieces and make yet another fortune-& laugh at us!
373741348828221440 Obama now just wants to save face, Russia is now telling him don't do it. He waited too long and the other side is much better prepared.

373581528405905408 The President must get Congressional approval before attacking Syria-big mistake if he does not!
373557904861069312 How bad has our leader made us look on Syria. Stay out of Syria, we don't have the leadership to win wars or even strategize.

373154339873103872 What a shame that @msnbc's ratings have sunk even lower in 2013. Prime time down 50%. @TheRevAl's are (cont)
373146637184401408 What will we get for bombing Syria besides more debt and a possible long term conflict? Obama needs Congressional approval.
373145053482319872 Congress must protect our borders first. Amnesty should be done only if the border is secure and illegal immigration has stopped.
373139304932851712 Thx Mark--I appreciate your words about the school. You sound like you're doing well--happy for you. @businessinsider
373125728771923968 @realDonaldTrump @icer100 Remember Obama so loved the poor he created millions more! Interesting!
373125043292606464 @realDonaldTrump remembering your generosity to so many after #SuperstormSandy. Thank you Marlena.
373121062998798337 If Christian Bale turned down $50M to return as Batman he should have his head examined. What was he thinking?!

373089917200777216 Wow, @CNBC ratings are really low, worst in many years. I guess I'll have to start doing my Tuesday morning interviews with them again!
373087155796451329 @tanjas_world Tanja--never give up!
373060025134374912 The United States needs to fix its own problems, of which there are many, first!
373058887404228608 Let the Arab League take care of Syria. Why are these rich Arab countries not paying us for the tremendous cost of such an attack?
373057367321374720 If we are going to continue to be stupid and go into Syria (watch Russia), as they say in the movies, SHOOT FIRST AND TALK LATER!
373056118811295744 I wonder what the great generals like Patton, the big M, or Robert E. LEE would have thought about our stupid broadcasting of an attack?
373054743742275584 @walaa_3ssaf No, dopey, I would not go into Syria, but if I did it would be by surprise and not blurted all over the media like fools.
372944249375162368 That said, the rich Arab countries should get involved with the Syrian mess, not us.We should start rebuilding our own country & military.
372943068267573249 Why do we keep broadcasting when we are going to attack Syria. Why can't we just be quiet and, if we attack at all, catch them by surprise?
372942065682108416 I give the President's speech a 7 on the scale of 0 to 10! Not bad but room for improvement!
372941456438493184 Why would anyone think Obama would attack Syria the day of his speech in Washington. He doesn't want to detract from his press & glory.
372827791441420288 @sonnset2 So true, not even close.
372827148836286464 @ThulisaKanzi Have the Arab League do it and pay for it.

372380500406448128 Has AG Schneiderman been extorting his targets and their lawyers for contributions? We will find out.

367355679394115585 The Patch, a total loser for @AOL, will be a good deal compared to @HuffingtonPost. @ariannahuff laughs at stupid Armstrong!

336923323751596033 Very sad that Republican donors were targeted by Obama's IRS.
336915412518330368 Isn't it amazing that Obama never knew about the IRS scandals until he saw it in the news?!
336909426130821121 Shock - Obama WH given three pinocchios for lying about Benghazi emails
336899952754188289 @JillToma Hi Amy, see you soon.

336573352808439808 @CassandraJ0y @LilJon Thank you.
336563000314052609 We may get out of ObamaCare because the train wreck is impossible to implement It is a disaster.
336558816034435072 Everyone should go see @HatingBreitbart. Great documentary showcasing @AndrewBreitbart's legacy.
336540396857483265 @TraceAdkins- the winner of @ApprenticeNBC after last night's victory-

336195880820563968 @subirchowdhury How are you - $5.5 million (a bargain).
336155726214991872 The cast for next season looks really good!
336130824120451072 Just left the set of The Apprentice - the live show tonight will be fantastic - and something very big and very different is going to happen
336112904946454528 How badly will the Country be hurt by the three scandals and the very poor implementation and cost of Obama Care?
336109470402891777 @Lord_Sugar Much more than anybody knows dopey, much more - and it will soon be revealed in detail.
336106805501517826 @ToddFouche1 On that I would beat almost everyone!
336104842927931392 @GregE_IoM. Only in your weak mind!
336104282673774592 @workplayeat Thanks, only the haters disagree!
336103723740827648 @CraigHeff I don't, he makes me money!
336101551334637569 Sugar is nowhere near being a billionaire-and I know, he works for me!
336092972175224833 @Subhana_Anwar It's easy, just think of haters as losers with.little imagination and even less understanding of success-and very lazy!
335975338989473792 @carlyvowell Tell your friends son - YOU'RE FIRED TUMOR!
335941672926052353 @JedediahBila Tell your aunt she is terrific!
335937660126392320 @omegaphoenix068 Rather amazing, wasn't it!
335933977477128192 I'm watching Knicks game-I'd bet all of those guys with the terrible tattoos wish they never got them-too bad, too late!
335573252099428353 Why didn't President Obama just go inside when it started raining yesterday - common sense! The two Marines looked very uncomfortable-& wet.

335410681048334338 The sexual abuse that is so rampant has, according to generals, greatly weakened our military. They have failed to stop it.
335410582230540289 Just inÃ¢all efforts to stop sexual abuse in the military have totally failedÃ¢in fact, the stoppers have become the abusers.
335393426973552640 @NYMag is a piece of garbage but I think it is very nice & charitable that they employ the no-talent illiterate hack @jonathanchait.
335390160386666496 Congratulations to my friend @seanhannity on @hannityshow 1,000th show consecutively #1 in his time slot! Great going!
335376441950760960 @CCV77 Thanks, very nice.
335348812665204736 Celebrity Apprentice will be LIVE on Sunday at 9 PM (from New York City).Casting has already begun for next season.
335343790837616641 In other words, our military has a very big problem!
335343096592228352 Unfortunately with some men when the poison kicks in (not me of course) there are no rules or guidelines in the military that will stop them
335340226035736576 I was never a fan of Bush 2 FOR MANY REASONS, including the fact that we should never have gone into Iraq but once there, kept the oil! DUMB
335338334794702848 Our very stupidly run Country better stop being so politically correct or we won't have a Country to run anymore!
335337314580586497 Many generals and military leaders are now saying I told you so! They say this will have big impact on military strength & national sec.
335336098152738818 General says that the Armed Forces will be severely weakened if the large scale rape and sexual abuse problem is not brought under control.
335330801216536576 Army officer who led a sexual abuse prevention unit was just fired after being charged with violently going after his wife.What is going on?
335328551937142784 America's top Army general has warned of a crisis unless sexual abuse in the military is quickly brought undet control.Forces greatly hurt!
335238149418659840 @LCBeaudoin Big Second Amendment believer but background checks to weed out the sicko's are fine.
335236627590942721 @blakemharris But they are the folks I like the best - by far!
335235148746465281 @joeypiazza Way less - and you are soooo stupid!
335232727391547392 Looks like we will have a pervert running for mayor after all - just what New York City needs - and he will revert back to form, always do!
335228695432269827 @chrishansen Good to see you also - I will be watching!

335041781370589184 @MikeFromTN @mcuban @JeremyPage3011 Thanks Michael.
335039301870043136 Obama & his people did a brilliant job of delaying these scandals until after the election. Mitt must be going wild thinking about it!
335039172232478721 If these scandals happened before the election, Obama could not have won.
335038801539919872 @Jared808 @commonguymd @AP True!
335037930097745921 @sarah_bales1 True and thanks.
334884647244804096 @polotodd804 This is one of the worst made and inaccurate documentaries I have ever seen. Filmmaker Mike Tollin has zero talent.Also-boring
334864704222687232 I wonder what the next scandal will be in D.C.? Can we handle yet another?
334851816309284865 The three political disasters could lead to a major and complete political meltdown!
334842549900554240 The lady in Chicago that I'm fighting owes me $500, 000 and is sophisticated & vicious. She made up a story & plays the age card - bad!
334834807483817985 I totally respect that Angelina Jolie has shown such great bravery in the face of danger - she has really come a long and positive way!
334832203219472384 @AndyBarovick Really terrible and a sad day for our Country!

334039467805515777 Benghazi. Obama lied. Our people died.
334033919647309824 @LilJon once again made it to the Final Four. A true talent and great friend to #CelebApprentice @ApprenticeNBC. Great job!
334027989476077568 @lisarinna did amazing on #CelebApprentice @ApprenticeNBC. Raising over $505K for @StJude, she made it to the Final Four. Congrats Lisa.

333420498107121665 @QFiveFarms Thanks and true!
333336204072321024 @persvanstrom Based on your picture I can see why - you look lost and in need of a cheap lifeline.
333334464262463490 @mikeluis93 Mark Cuban is a bully who is physically very soft and therefore should immediately stop wearing T shirts. No strength!
333332174948413440 @Lord_Sugar can't hold a.candle to Donald.Trump - he is a laughing stock in Great Britain (but his show pays me lots of money, so I'm happy)
333330689313357825 The success of Shark Tank over the years is a total joke compared to the success of The Apprentice, one of the biggest hits in T.V. history.
333329213966913536 @african11 But I love insulting people who don't have the goods but think they do!
333328281245986816 The Apprentice, on the other hand, has been a MAJOR television hit, often times finishing #1. Even now, after 13 seasons, it wins its slot!
333326554593648640 @mcuban is a short ball hitter who had a massive failure on television, The Benefactor. Now he is one of many on a modest ratings show, S T.
333318229357371392 @BrianLynch @DurantRandy Thanks, no wonder our Country is in such trouble!

333090728815255552 @MaxVayner Your man, little Jon S(?) can't win, he's not smart enough or quick enough!
333089735570493440 @caaataclysm Little Jon Stewart(?) Is a pussy, he would be hopeless in a debate with me!
333087340744560640 @MaxVayner Stewart (?) wouldn't have even a little chance in a debate with me. He's totally overrated - not fast enough or smart enough!
333064774885732352 @GuerrillaTycoon Not even close - he is just, as you know, a very bad copy (who I profit from).
333063999656701952 @chef_riggy I never endorsed Judd - I'm with Senator Mitch all the way!
333054958696030208 Just left Trump National Doral in Miami - under massive construction - The Blue Monster will be one of the greatest courses ever built!
333050909447815168 Leightweight @Lord Sugar virtually begged my reps to have me stop mocking him. Every time this dope goes on Apprentice I make money-too easy

332766796375531520 @PennyStocksBlog You are 100% correct - thank you!
332764927313973248 Dummy, I'm asking a question - look at the question mark at the end of the sentence! Use your head.
332575813549584384 @limbaugh is right. Watergate is much different than Benghazi. No one died in Watergate.

330360907580448768 Jon Stewart @TheDailyShow is a total phony Ã¢he should cherish his pastÃ¢not run from it.
330360556362018816 If Jon Stewart is so above it all & legit, why did he change his name from Jonathan Leibowitz? He should be proud of his heritage!
330360351726116864 What's funny about the name F**kface Von Clownstick -- it was not coined by Jon Leibowitz-- he stole it from some moron on twitter.
330359969813770242 Amazing how the haters & losers keep tweeting the name F**kface Von Clownstick like they are so original & like no one else is doing it...

326164475185078272 George also appeared on Saturday Night Live when I was guest host in 2004. A great time! #CelebApprentice
326162110100946945 George Ross and I have done some great real estate deals together. He's a tough negotiator. #CelebApprentice
326161496113545216 Looking forward to @THEGaryBusey's book of Buseyisms!
326158732818006016 Romance or Adventure- what do you prefer? #CelebApprentice
326158212317446144 For you newcomers, George Ross was one of my first advisors on the original Apprentice. #CelebApprentice
326154568775901186 George has a real twinkle about him says @TheRealMarilu. Really? The shark should be scared. #CelebApprentice
326152508596703232 This assignment has been a challenge to both teams. #CelebApprentice
326149787953012737 This assignment has stretched not just the imaginations but the patience quotas of @lisarinna and @pennjillette. #CelebApprentice
326148634615873537 George Ross could be rightÃ¢@THEGaryBusey would be better in the adventure task than the romance task. #CelebApprentice
326147245638549506 @TraceAdkins isn't excited about their ideas. Are you? #CelebApprentice
326146589192224769 @THEGaryBusey is making no attempt to help. Is he in BuseyLand? Their team is short on help alreadyÃ¢Â¦ #CelebApprentice

326141765490966528 I hope you are watching the Apprentice...tonight's show is great and Brett Michaels is back!
326141067873353729 Everybody loves @bretmichaels! He's a great champion and this is where he should be. He agrees!
326140652079423488 @bretmichaels and George Ross are back as advisors. Good to see them! #CelebApprentice
326140176214667265 @TraceAdkins presents the NJ Coast Red Cross a $40,000 check for Sandy Relief. You can tell he's very pleased about that--& rightly so.
326138910172381185 Seems like the teams are surprised when @THEGaryBusey comes back. #CelebApprentice
326089541641445377 What do you think of water boarding the Boston killer sometime prior to allowing our doctors to make him well? I suspect he may talk!
326086644258181120 Make the Boston killer talk before our doctors make him better. Once he is well he will say, speak to my lawyers.
326078967578783745 Don't forget to watch Celebrity Apprentice tonight at 9pm...you will love it!
326078000829452288 I don't know how Al Michaels could have been drunk and arrested on Friday night if he was totally sharp on Saturday morning.
326077213759897600 Great sportscaster Al Michaels, a friend of mine, played golf with me on Saturday morning at Trump National, LA. He was in perfect shape!
326001318806319104 If the Boston killer applies for Obama Care the paperwork will be too complicated for him to understand!
325999319515791360 NO MERCY TO TERRORISTS you dumb bastards!
325996880779698177 Can you imagine the Boston killer being lovingly tended to in a hospital room right next to his victims who lost their arms, legs and worse!
325995925367566338 Bullshit-Pop gave me knowledge and a relatively small amount of money (split between brothers and sisters) and I built it into over 9 bill.
325982969040879620 @CoachClintSwan Tell me, what were they doing in the Park, playing checkers?
325981683998404611 Watch Gary B tonight on Celebrity Apprentice-some really crazy things happen!
325981060104077313 Getting back to the nicer and more normal parts of life, Celebrity Apprentice is great tonight on NBC at 9. It will be a full two hour show!
325975054972235776 You are right, the media is always offending Donald Trump-they have no limits-but they will do anything not to offend the Boston killer!
325973644276809730 I know some of you may think l'm tough and harsh but actually I'm a very compassionate person (with a very high IQ) with strong common sense
325971381823082496 Didn't the Boston killer even run over his own brother with a car in order to get away? We are not dealing with an innocent baby here-DEATH
325970245489680384 When the stupid people start feeling sorry for the Boston killer and want to release him and give him medals, remember the killings-maimings
325967345136836609 I hate when the news media, so afraid to offend anyone, always refers to the BOSTON KILLER as the suspect.
325965355535196162 The shirts and ties at Macy's are so good-beautiful and do so well that guys like the one that sued me wrongly want a piece-l kicked his ass
325963875382095873 I just won a big Court decision (N.Y. Post) against some character who claimed I owed him licensing fees on success of my shirts and ties.
325961409773072386 Oh no, they are worried that they didn't read the Boston killer his rights and he may have a good legal argument. 12 year case to finish? t
325597826824421376 Sorry, the best and most beautiful ties and shirts made anywhere and at a really reasonable cost. Also, fragrance is amazing. GO TO MACY'S.
325421118636818432 Great job by the FBI, Boston Police and all others involved-start the trial tonight!
325413682379120640 Is the Boston killer eligible for Obama Care to bring him back to health?
325411902777860097 Read my tweets you dopes-of course he should get a trial-but fast (not a 12 year disaster).
325407463799140353 You must be kidding-zero chance he is innocent!
325397568672649217 Get ALL the info, then quick trial, then death penalty for the Boston killer of innocent children and people! Do not be kind.
325355203522068480 @CNN should stop apologizing for the mistake they made the other day & get back to reporting!

325269270902759427 The @FBIPressOffice, police & others are doing an amazing job. How genius was it putting together that tape?
325268624015233025 These Tsarnaev brothers did not work alone. They had help and assistance from other cell members. Be vigilant and on the lookout.

318122658745159680 No, I'm saying that the World is paying the price for China's pollution while they make a fortune with their dirty factories! Very sad.
318117211665469441 Major article in New York Times today discusses the cost of environmental damage in China and how it is RAPIDLY GROWNG! Rest of World pays.
318113046822273027 China is the biggest environmental polluter in the World, by far. They do nothing to clean up their factories and laugh at our stupidity!
318085997000806400 We have tremendous economic power over China if our leaders knew how to use it, which they don't! China's economy would collapse without us.
317965135283093504 What do we get from our economic competitor South Korea for the tremendous cost of protecting them from North Korea? - NOTHING!
317962835974053888 North Korea is reliant on China. China could solve this problem easily if they wanted to but they have no respect for our leaders.

315109659742707712 When I think big, which is often, you can be sure I'm aware of the enormous amount of little things that we will have to account for.

314840859004772352 @1fos1 Pay attention, study more than what is required, keep your focus on the big picture. And good luck.
314838025169416192 See yourself as an organization. Pay attention to every facet of your life. What's strong? What's weak? What's missing?
314828077819641856 The difference between stupidity and genius is that genius has its limits. - Albert Einstein
314822247493799936 There won't be any new gun legislation. No surprise. Americans support the 2nd amendment.
314812467945541633 Life always presents new opportunities you would never expect. I hosted @WrestleMania & then I starred in one, which sold most PPVs.
314810856997261313 Make no mistake, Obamacare is the first step towards changing our health system into single payer. Just a disaster.
314805273590124544 Problem with @GOP is not their message, it's that they are incapable of controlling the message.
314798467056799745 According to @pewresearch, 2/3 of Mexican LEGAL immigrants do not pursue citizenship because of Ã¢no interest'
314792109288861696 Here's something about Donald Trump, he's got a top rated show on TV and everything he says becomes a headline.-@DLoesch All true!
314790653211062272 Yes, All-Star @ApprenticeNBC contestant @THEGaryBusey is a little out there. But he uses his Ã¢uniqueness' to his advantage.
314778362088415232 It won't stay a buyer's market forever. If you can, take advantage and buy property asap. You'll thank me!

314494837200150528 Haters, stop saying I went bankrupt, it is not so. I never went bankrupt...
314494821085630465 ... but like many other great business people have used the laws to corporate advantage.
314494224227778560 For the haters, out of hundreds of deals or transactions, I have used the bankruptcy laws 4 times in order to cut better deals.
314493376697339904 Almost every major dealmaker has used the bankruptcy laws as a business tool...
314493361019043840 ... Icahn, Kravis, Apollo and most others--but nobody says they went bankrupt!
314492888992075776 People buy deals & immediately put them into bankruptcy in order to make better deals...
314492875490615296 ... It is very effective and a commonly used business tool.
314491973484564481 Why do the losers & haters always say I wear a wig when they know I don't. Like it or not, it's all mineÃ¢just ask Barbara Walters.
314489079213465602 @chrisr52 Happy Birthday Christine.

314085754307497985 @RNC report was written by the ruling class of consultants who blew the election. Short on ideas. Just giving excuses to donors.
314085307882561536 One of the most obvious lessons on @ApprenticeNBC is for the candidates to learn to think quickly. - Think Like a Champion
314079247419457537 Does anyone remember the fight @mcuban had w/ the refereeÃ¢he was weak & patheticÃ¢a non-athlete trying to live life thru his players.
314077115408580608 Why do shows have @ananavarroÃ¢Ntl Hispanic Chair for the losing McCain '08 & Huntsman '12. She's a loser who doesn't deliver votes.

314068559196217344 @SarahPalinUSA did a great job @CPACnews. Much of what she said was plain old common sense.
314067889261015040 @hardball_chris became a super liberal Obama fan only because he must need the money--and on @MSNBC that's the way it is.

314011122518855680 @rushlimbaugh is rightÃ¢the Republicans lost because they weren't conservative enoughÃ¢or tough enough.
314002772892721153 But @mcuban is physically weak, he has no clubhead speed or game!

312299302414331905 There's a reason @mcuban's partners can't stand him and on top of that, the team sucks!

306888255842942978 Ashley Judd has just thanked Karl Rove for all the attention he has given herÃ¢unreal!Ã¢how stupid can we get?
306888079145328643 If Mitch McConnell wants to win his election, he'd better get rid of jinxed Karl Rove and fast...
306888065044074497 ... Rove's ad campaign has made Ashley Judd a totally credible candidate. Be careful Mitch!
306887332328521728 How come nobody mentions that the Nielsen Ratings of the Apprentice, after 12 seasons-- as shown by Howard Stern --totally blow away...

306473146037452800 One of the reasons, I assume, I was inducted into the @WWE Hall of Fame is that Vince McMahon and I have the all time highest ratings...
306473131718107137 ... and pay per view records with Battle of the Billionaires in Detroit. It was a wild day!

292296888185659392 @Oprah was great-- amazing that she got Lance Armstrong to totally destroy his life. Why did he ever do that interview?

291949663576264705 The interview with Oprah will cause Lance Armstrong huge legal and financial problems- sometimes it is better to go into a corner and hide.
291949326740115456 I'll bet Lance Armstrong wishes he didn't do the interview with Oprah-- he's saying to himself what was I thinking?
291947050948505600 @HBO should fire @BillMaher and bring back @DennisDMZ- someone that is actually funny.

291940267861356544 IMO--- Manti Te'o was involved in a hoax for sympathy to get the Heisman Trophy.
291939564908605440 Can it just be new age that Manti Te'o fell in love with a girl he never met or is it a hoax?
291939301057499136 Not believable that Manti Te'o was in love for one year with a girl he never met- she then died. He is either very stupid....
291939243419389953 ...or mentally troubled (or a con).

266971339775172609 The election was a major setback for economy. All young entrepreneurs should be sure to calculate Obama's policies into their investments.
266924030597152769 Of the 9 battleground states, we only carried North Carolina. I'm proud of @NCGOP & glad I delivered keynote at their state convention.

266661264992915457 China's Communist Party has now publicly praised Obama's reelection. They have never had it so good. Will own America soon.
266651083508699136 At the end of the day, Obama won the battleground states by less than 500,000 votes. This was a winnable race. GOP needs to do better!

266227159528534017 Brian--Thanks dummy--I picked up 70,000 twitter followers yesterday alone. Cable News just passed you in the ratings. @NBCNightlyNews

265570059752189954 The outer boroughs of Manhattan are still devasted by Sandy. How would the press cover this if a Republican was President.
265568179978383360 China is worried. The polls are trending for @MittRomney. They won't be able to steal from us anymore.

265561092435091456 @mcuban, Shark Tank was shoved to Friday evening-- Friday is considered dead television. Besides, you are not the star (& never will be).
265560730441498626 Obama just stated It's always good to ignore Donald Trump. I state he is right, especially when the truth is against him.

265538847801212928 Don't believe Chrysler (if Obama wins)--see how fast @Jeep production will be moved to China--and I'll be watching!
265537853440790528 @mcuban When Apprentice became the #1 show on tv you tried copying me with The Benefactor- a complete and total ratings disaster for @ABC.
265537298265948160 Only 1 mill. dollars @mcuban? Offer me real money and I'd consider it. Your team and networks lose so much money I doubt you have much left!
265536299442782208 Dummy @mcuban is at it again trying to use me to get publicity for himself!
265532178077732864 In '08, America voted for Hope & Change. Instead, we got incompetency. Now it is time to put a real job creator in office. Vote 4 Mitt!
265526910891732992 Obama's policies have led to food stamp rolls growing 75X faster than job production We can't afford 4 more years.
265509421243834369 My @foxandfriends interview discussing @newsday's endorsement of @MittRomney, tomorrow's election and Sandy's victims
265500285298937856 Nice mention by Brian Kelly
265496271794630656 We can't destroy the competitiveness of our factories in order to prepare for nonexistent global warming. China is thrilled with us!
265485225994383363 Great article in the @NewYorkPost by Ben Garrett--Don't Blame Sandy on Global Warming
265482479547318272 It's extremely cold in NY & NJÃ¢not good for flood victims. Where is global warming?
265480543238512640 Get out tomorrow and vote so that we can all finally say those magic words---
265476862820634626 Thank you to @piersmorgan for your nice statement about me in the @HollywoodReporter
265476443138572288 @CNN is looking at Jeff Zucker to lead them out of the forest--Jeff would be a great choice.
265474730130276354 Remember, go vote--we need real change this time.
265460364307746816 @Lorrainejuliet @EDLTrobinson @FloridaJayhawk @hannityshow Must be careful & smart!
265460199089913856 @ewim55 Then he wouldn't be president.
265459894671507456 @TrickettTweeter No, his facts are very bad for him.
265296221730639872 @ralphreed is doing a great job!
265214105001029634 This is a time for big ideas. This is a time for real reform for a real recovery. -- @PaulRyanVP
265164869882494979 Remember when you vote, Obamacare is a disaster!
265133112755900416 @MittRomney will turn this mess around!
265132904684855296 Make sure you get out and vote...most important election of our generation...go Romney!
265132601365368833 Trump Hotels are delivering lots of food to storm victims...we love doing it!
264896026056462336 Gary Johnson is asking people to waste their vote on him. Make it count - vote for @MittRomney.
264884389639491584 We don't want to have a recount in any of the battleground states. Obama will steal it. Make sure all your friends and family vote.
264880505613328385 Obama's war on women has lead to the biggest decline in female employment in 40 years. 4 more years??
264787348032733185 Undecideds in OH,PA and WI will make the difference. All should ask themselves if they want $6/gallon gas because it will come under Obama.
264781321593827329 Pennsylvania is in play @MittRomney. All undecideds in Philly suburbs should ask themselves - who do you trust most on @Israel?
264507630398103552 I think @TheRevAl should take this challenge. Axelrod was too scared. RT: @RonKaufmanIntrn: Kaufstache vs. Sharpstache.
264458378976296960 In the heart of the city, Trump International Toronto is the city's most elite property True luxury at its finest.
264455651428794368 Considering Obama hasn't proposed anything concrete, if he wins he won't have a mandate. Another 4 years of legislative stalemate.
264455094404259840 Members from Obama's own job council are endorsing @MittRomney Not surprising
264453373988847617 Concerns over the national debt are stopping businesses from hiring and expanding Obama's policies are unsustainable
264453195059838976 Castro, Chavez and Ahmadinejad are all anxiously awaiting our election results. They are praying Obama wins.
264452984602255360 Obama promised 5.2% unemployment by October 2012. His promises are worthless!
264452740657315841 Go as far as you can see; when you get there, you'll be able to see farther. -- J.P. Morgan
264448271412514816 Make sure to catch @history's season finale of The Men Who Built America on Sun, November 11th. Great show.
264444623353704448 Reality TV's #1 Bad Girl @OMAROSA is back on the upcoming 13th season of All Star @CelebApprentice. She is great as always.
264442341060927488 Could be the hurricane helps @MittRomney--people are rioting in the streets over gasoline
264441602636906496 Global warming is based on faulty science and manipulated data which is proven by the emails that were leaked
264440759858638848 Obama has destroyed the middle class. In '09, median household income was $55,198. Now it is $50,678. Four more years?
264437755529015296 I have an idea for A-Rod---buy a home at @TrumpGolfLA overlooking the Pacific--will bring you better luck.
264436501729931264 A-Rod is now looking for an expensive home in Beverly Hills--why aren't the @Yankees terminating his contract for misrepresentation?
264434837937586176 @eagles should sit Michael Vick. He is a great athlete but less than average quarterback.
264432824575221760 Obama our Welfare & Food Stamp President, is praising himself for expanding welfare He doesn't believe in work.
264432651329482752 We don't need a Secretary of Business to understand business, we need a president who understands business and I do -- @MittRomney
264432455593906176 Unemployment is now 7.9%. Four years and $6.5T later, that is really bad!
264423327655931904 How about President Obama fixing the gasoline situation instead of taking photo ops in the destruction.
264416515124776961 Interestingly, the hurricane may now be a disaster for Obama's reelection because of his grandstanding.
264415457858183169 People are struggling to get gasoline for their cars--we are like a third world country.
264413104832667648 I'm sending lots of bottled water out to Staten Island & Long Island.
264401551660044288 @TheRevAl came to my Trump Tower office to apologize for calling me a racist--very nice, apology accepted!
264395496876015617 @BarbaraJWalters called my office to ask me to do election night coverage with her--sadly, I won't be able to do it.
264393975442571264 @RalphGilles of Chrysler should focus on design rather than filthy language--not very professional.
264393007623716866 We should not allow @Chrysler to move @Jeep jobs to China after they said they wouldn't--stay tuned!
264392738118701056 @Chrysler disputes my statement--but watch Chrysler move @Jeep jobs to China after the election.
264390196819283968 With long gas lines & total disarray from storm, the hurricane may yet be a negative for Obama.
264389666608926720 It was announced this morning that unemployment rose--this can't be good for Obama.
264380145652080640 Next year I will be changing the name of 800 acre Doral to Trump National Doral. It will be the best resort in the countryÃ¢Miami is hot!
264377842157092865 I will start reviewing various political reporters etc & websites as to their professionalism & fairnessÃ¢many people asking for this.
264375651975458816 How could Obama leave those American heroes out to die in Benghazi? And he continues to lie to the public!
264369789600940033 What is your thought as to why Obama refused millions for charity and did not show his records and applications?
264369600093900801 Nice to see Obama released a situation room photo from Sandy. How about releasing the photo taken during Benghazi?
264365573520101376 Everybody knows why Obama would not show his college applications --- they are just not willing to say!
264365260213981184 If I would have offered Obama a billion dollars to show his records, he would have refused.
264052120704135168 My video response to President Obama's lack of transparency.
264044128134893568 Press release. Video response to follow.
264034523451371521 I will soon be releasing my response to the fact that President Obama refused to show his applications and records to the public.
264034130772254720 President Obama missed the deadline!
264022096538120192 Obama is a terrible negotiator. He bails out Chrysler and now Chrysler wants to send all Jeep manufacturing to China--and will!
264021186990731265 Why is Obama's auto bailout now creating jobs in China? He is ruining American industry.
264015329108316160 To all @MittRomney supporters, make sure you have taken advantage of early voting now so you can GOTV on election day.
264010661326102530 Romney's $2 Billion Sacrifice for America By Chris Ruddy @Newsmax_Media
264010129106665472 You know the world is crazy when New York gets hit by a hurricane-- and Florida doesn't.
264009741234221058 Let's continue to destroy the competitiveness of our factories & manufacturing so we can fight mythical global warming. China is so happy!
264007296970018816 Do you believe @algore is blaming global warming for the hurricane?
264006067569168384 From 1954 to 1960 there were 10 major hurricanes that hit the East Coast.
264003799755153408 It's 10 AM: Two hours to go for Obama to easily pick up millions for charity!
263750452477321216 The successful man will profit from his mistakes and try again in a different way. -- Dale Carnegie
263746662978166785 Obama is now standing in a puddle acting like a President--give me a break.
263745436534312961 A lot of people are concerned about which charity my $5M will be donated to. The onus is on Obama to first release his records.
263743692781809665 President Obama, if it is important to you, I will substantially increase the $5M offer!
263743481091084288 President Obama, please take the $5M check for charity tomorrow. It is so easy and could do so much good!
263742355658645506 Thanks for all the nice words on my keeping the Trump Tower atrium accessible to stranded victims of #Sandy. My honor.
263732387861647360 Congratulations to @MittRomney on getting the @DMRegister, @NewYorkPost, @NewYorkObserver & @NashuaTelegraph endorsements!
263732061179879424 Spoiler--@dennisrodman has really got his act together so far on the upcoming season of @CelebApprentice...
263731722854748160 #TRUMP International Reality will be America's premiere real estate brokerage house w/ the most distinctive services.
263730679819423744 How does a dummy like @billmaher get a television show--& his ratings stink. You'd think @HBO could do a lot better.
263726211296010240 A lot of undecided and independent voters have had enough with Obama's lack of transparency. I don't blame them.
263724431451504641 There is nothing I would be happier to do than to donate the $5M to a charity of Obama's choice, once he releases all of his records.
263721254182338560 Looking at the figures and plans behind @Disney's acquisition of Lucas Film makes you realize how stupid @AOL (cont)
263720538923470848 @Disney's acquisition of Lucas Film is a smart deal for both sides. Disney just bought a great brand which will keep producing revenue.
263719827552759808 In the spirit of transparency, Obama should immediately release the 9.11 tape of Tyrone Woods pleading for military support in Benghazi.
263718643068706817 Today Barack Obama is standing in water in NJ. Remember on election day that he has put the US underwater.
263718338021179392 How many illegal foreign donations will Obama collect this final week? Another scandal ignored by the liberal media.
263717038965542912 Congratulations Kevin Gabriel on your amazing article. If I were a journalist this would be the next Watergate, and I would be a star.
263708757593296896 An amazing article by Kevin Gabriel- A must read by friends and foes of President Obama. End date is tomorrow at noon.
263691262819987456 @oreillyfactor called me a master marketeer last night--I am not. I am a great builder--I build great things & people come.
263687394295963648 Part 2 of my @jimmyfallon interview giving away some @CelebApprentice spoilers & discussing 2012 Miss Universe Pageant
263687274812813312 Part 1 of my @jimmyfallon interview discussing my $5M offer to Obama, #TRUMP Tower atrium, my tweets & 57th st. crane
263676632466866176 Kevin Garnett's response to Ray Allen last night was that of a great competitor--nothing wrong--in fact it was terrific. A champion!
263675915861651456 I was standing with @SHAQ when a young high school star, Kevin Garnett @Celtics, said to a crowd Forget Shaq, I want to meet Donald Trump.
263650077283872769 Watch the clip from @Late_Show where the crowd cheers after I explain that my offer is about transparency
263649765248602113 I'm not hearing much from Obama or his administration about my $5M offer to charity-- or to which charity the money will go.
263649063847739392 The President has until tomorrow at 12 noon to pick up $5M for his favorite charity. Looking like he won't be doing it. What is he hiding?
263489601975504896 Watch me tonight on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.
263365011106316288 The polls & momentum are trending towards @MittRomney. Don't let the hurricane change your thinking!
263356437315588096 Fans shouldn't worry. We have adjusted the filming schedule of the upcoming 13th season of @CelebApprentice appropriately due to the storm.
263355752134098944 China's stock market rose yesterday after 4 consecutive days of losses Their market gains the day we are hit by storm
263354106930950144 Maybe Obama should donate my $5M to the families of the 17 who have lost loved ones during the storm?
263353955483004929 Scary. Obama and the Democrat Senate have accrued over $5T worth of debt without passing a budget in the last 3 years. 4 more years?
263349278674653185 People are happy that I left the Trump Tower atrium open as opposed to taking the easy way out.
263348204068810752 Why does Obama believe he shouldn't comply with record releases that his predecessors did of their own volition? Hiding something?
263344365991256065 @digiphile @RedCross RT if you think Pres.Obama should release his records to get $5M for charity--for Red Cross or another great charity
263341678197342208 Glad to hear that @taylorswift13 will be co-hosting the Grammy nominations special on 12.5. Taylor is terrific!
263337384018579456 Let's be honest, if Obama thought he could get away with campaigning during the storm, then he would have been in Ohio on Monday.
263336959118819329 How did Obama go to a Las Vegas fundraiser on 9.12, the day after he refused to send help to Americans in Benghazi?
263335955677712384 Without focus, it's just impossible to be successful at anything. --Midas Touch
263335564412076032 I never fall for scams. I am the only person who immediately walked out of my Ã¢Ali G' interview
263332588033302529 Another great cause Obama could send my $5M donation to is a charity for 9/11 First Responders. They are American heroes.
263330454608945152 My @SquawkCNBC interview discussing the 57th St. crane, damage from the storm and extending my $5M offer to Obama
263330130808676352 My @extratv interview before Hurricane Sandy explaining that I would be staying in Trump Tower during the storm
263329165997113344 These last 4 years have not had a single quarter over 4% GDP. Obama has overseen the weakest economic recovery in American history.
263328466039103488 The election is trending towards @MittRomney. Americans know we can't afford another 4 years of the Obama economic decline.
263324283852427264 So many incredible friends said thanks for TT help --- I say thanks to you!
263320657767567360 The Trump Tower atrium is such a great place & kept thousands of people warm & safe during the storm--thanks, staff!
263306494055964672 Remember this: Obama wants to raise taxes, @MittRomney wants to lower taxes--need I say more!
263306359439753216 Don't let Obama buy the election by handing out unlimited free money to states.
263299735979425793 People having a great time in the Trump Tower atrium --- unlike others, I stayed open.
263286265934381058 I am the best builder but if that were my building with the crane mishap, I would have been lambasted from coast to coast.
263281113416486912 Because of the hurricane, I am extending my 5 million dollar offer for President Obama's favorite charity until 12PM on Thursday.
263280672146337792 Not only giving out money, but Obama will be seen today standing in water and rain like he is a real President --- don't fall for it.
263280389039218690 Hurricane is good luck for Obama again- he will buy the election by handing out billions of dollars.
263273965676539904 I saw from my window just before accident that the crane was not properly anchored for the storm.
263265570705780736 The water damage to NYC is amazing. The winds were bad but the water was worse.
262996863777636352 All weights are on crane's wrong side --- very precarious below, move out!
262996677466652672 If authorities need direct view from top of Trump Tower, call office.
262996426458546178 Direct view of crane from apartment window. Crane was never properly secured, blowing in the breeze.
262982737416290304 We are taking care of hundreds of people in the Trump Tower atrium--they are seeking refuge. Free coffee and food.
262981828057636864 So far the hurricane is being handled very well in NY, not nearly as bad as stated on news. Let's see what happens later.
262976896512442368 Many people walked out on Madonna's concert when she told them to vote for Obama. Years ago I walked out because the concert was terrible!
262973450707140609 I always said Obama is lucky for himself but unlucky for the country. The storm could be very good for him as he (cont)
262962981078458368 Obama lied 100% about Libya and the killings--emails are absolute. He must release his records on Wednesday and stop the lies.
262955491309805568 Dave Letterman @Late_Show said during my interview that Obama was probably born in the US--the word probably is a disaster for Obama.
262954327822446593 I'm not hearing much from Obama or his administration about my $5M offer to charity or to which charity the money will go.
262594270769336320 What people don't know about @BillMaher is that he was a terrible student and not considered smart in his early (cont)
262586538603446272 I guess @BillMaher saw my ratings on the @Late_Show the other night where Letterman beat Leno. Bill, you are no Letterman.
262584296081068033 While @BetteMidler is an extremely unattractive woman, I refuse to say that because I always insist on being politically correct.
262583859709882369 @BetteMidler talks about my hair but I'm not allowed to talk about her ugly face or body --- so I won't. Is this a double standard?
262558532757487616 Many people are saying that my challenge to Obama is having a huge negative effect on his poll numbers --- I agree.
262557984817823744 A lot changed when David Letterman said he was probably born in this country--- the word probably is a total disaster for Obama.
262278479708557312 @johnsununu is taking major heat for calling the president lazy. But the president stated his weakness is that he is lazy. Fight on John!
262277919597015040 @BernardMcGuirk. That's more than O'Reilly did ...and he is supposed to be my friend. You're terrific!
262277584568606721 @Bernard McGuirk Thanks for being so nice and defending me on O'Reilly...you're terrific!
262274686442950656 Alert...The president knew that the ambassador was being attacked in Benghazi. He did nothing...he is no leader.
262149064735469570 @DonnyDeutsch tries so hard to be a star. But, he just doesn't have what it takes...and he never will.
262148750036852736 I put @DonnyDeutsch on Apprentice at his request, I did his failed cable show as a favor to him then he knocks me for my Obama announcement.
261942137367719936 I want to end the day by saying there is no check I would rather write than that to a good charity designated by our President.
261938362137587712 The TODAY Show should call me about who to put on the showÃ¢ I know more about people who get ratings than anyone.
261936855950438400 Before Star Jones begged me to put her on The Apprentice she was professionally dead. I saved her tiny...

261927178046943232 Watch Obama's favorability numbers drop even further if he doesn't accept my charitable offer. No one approves (cont)
261926710562406400 If Obama doesn't accept my offer to be fully transparent, what will he say?
261926062093651969 If my offer is refused, every undecided OH voter will be fully aware that Obama denied $5M to charity all because he is hiding something!
261925589936648192 Barack Obama has everything to gain. Why would anyone ever deny $5M to charity?
261922628309221376 Great! Last night @CelebApprentice winner @johnrich & alumni @RealMeatLoaf packed OH stadium rallying w/ @MittRomney

261921511634518016 Sarah Jessica Parker voted unsexiest woman alive Ã¢ I agree. She said it's beneath me to comment on the...
261918944854679555 I have decided to add a caveat to my offer. Obama can't decide to send my $5M to Rev. Wright if he releases his records.
261918581187571713 My fellow Tea Party friends in Ohio--make sure you take advantage of early voting so you can GOTV election day. Know you can! Must win Ohio.
261917839865286656 Where's the transparency? Despite Obama's denial @sfchronicle stands by report he just talked with Jeremiah Wright.
261914283682705408 Looking forward to being the special guest at tonight's Dutchess County #GOP dinner--to a SOLD OUT crowd. It will be great fun.
261909039238217728 Pretty audacious for Obama to call @MittRomney a BSer when he has lied about so much we don't have room to write.
261903226918559744 By the way, where is @Oprah? Good question. 4 years ago she strongly supported Obama--now she is silent. Anyway, who cares, I adore Oprah.
261902189650407424 ...Colin Powell thought Iraq has weapons of mass destruction.
261901502430461953 Obama is about to destroy the mililtary through the sequester. The Middle East is a mess. Yet Colin Powell still endorses him. Wonder why?
261899230673784832 Be careful of an Obama bomb to win election! Would be a horrible thing to do.
261898885067317250 The election is still close but trending toward @MittRomney. He leads all national polls and Obama's likeability is imploding. VOTE!
261875987174789120 Wow! Letterman show @Late_Show won the ratings last night big time--and guess who was his guest? DJT
261866799732228097 One of my many Twitter followers suggested Obama should take my offer & give $1,250,000 to each family of the four...
261858064104304640 Watch me explain on the @Late_Show how my charitable offer to Obama changes the election and is about transparency
261856842928488448 A clip from last night's @Late_Show where I detail my charitable offer to Obama and Dave describes his terrible grades
261852431753822208 What a dumb mistake AOL made buying the @huffingtonpost. How much longer will Arianna last--I predict not much.
261850058687905793 @MikeMpef Thanks, I hope you enjoyed it, had a great time.
261848811478081536 @destiny_113 @StephenAtHome I agree.
261848483118604288 @MaureenPeronne @Late_Show Thanks, it was a great show..
261847236508528641 @MRJMF1 @Late_Show Thanks I will.
261845977294569473 Stupid Arianna @huffingtonpost hired the man who ruined the once-great NYTimes Business Section...
261845939172540416 ...a real loser named Tim O'Brien--and it's never recovered.
261844961358643200 Dopey Arianna @huffingtonpost is really after me--boring story after boring story...but I hear she is in big trouble!
261844548806905856 I knew last year that @TIME Magazine lost all credibility when they didn't include me in their Top 100...
261844492905242626 ... I will soon start naming magazines that I think will fold--I predicted Newsweek.
261843117152559104 @seketa77 I hope so for the charity's sake
261842687370612736 The Letterman show really turned things around- people finally understand my $5 million dollar offer to charity....
261841339879157760 @LianneOnLife I love the Wounded Warriors--Obama should choose that as his $5M charity.
261840768199716865 @RyanSeven Sounds like a good idea.
261840564050333697 @Erizzle05 Only because he has something to hide.
261839402723049472 @SabrinaSiddiqui Re: Taylor and Conor--great news for Taylor!
261830910733852673 Based on the ovation last night from the Letterman @Late_Show audience, I believe it will be hard for Obama to throw $5M down the drain....
261830887061196800 ....instead of giving to a wonderful charitable cause.
261830243923415040 Another great charity that the $5M could go to just a recommendation to the Pres. - the Wounded Warriors represented so well by @TraceAdkins
261828838185631744 Lots of response that Obama should give the $5M to the families of our great heroes who were murdered in Benghazi.
261828439059873792 Letterman @Late_Show was great last night. I had a lot of fun. You could see his audience really wanted Obama to take the $ for charity.
261812357771177984 The dealmaker is cunning, secretive, focused and never settles for less than he wants. --The America We Deserve
261574435226669058 It is really a shame that Barack Obama may stop $5M from being generously donated to charity all because he refuses to be transparent.
261570029114511361 Doing David Letterman @Late_Show tonight at 11:30. 1st nite of Sweeps.Going into the lion's den but I've been there many times before. Enjoy
261564030613856256 Six days and counting until my offer to Barack Obama expires...
261561564799328257 For someone who demanded 20 years of Mitt's tax returns, you would think my offer to donate $5M to charity for his records is an easy go.
261552946565750785 Yesterday Barack Obama said he wants wind turbines manufactured here in China I don't think this was a gaffe.
261552582504366080 China is primed to continue to rob us and steal our jobs through their exports We need @MittRomney to rein them in.
261538707075637248 I hope Derek Jeter's recovery is going well. He is a very special player and a great guy. New York loves him. @yankees
261531569653686272 Trump Offers To Donate $5 Million To Charity If Obama Releases College Transcripts via @rcpvideo
261529446379577344 @politico has really become a laughing stock of good political reporting.
261527071220699136 What will be the response on Wednesday? If Obama doesn't take the 5 million dollars for charity.
261526641493307394 @michellemalkin I fully supported McCain but when he lost, hoped Obama would be great for U.S. --- he wasn't.
261525723469201409 @Mark_Sanchez shouldn't be too upset over @EvaLongoria. He will always do great!
261512941885603840 I am offering the chance for Barack Obama to redistribute $5M to any charity of his choice. Everyone wins. Take the deal.
261511394367770624 Our side needs Donald Trump. -- @AnnCoulter on @seanhannity's show last night. Thanks Ann.
261509456393818114 @BarbaraJWalters @theviewtv--Why did you choose me as one of the 10 Most Fascinating People of the Year last season (and more than once?)
261509037445754881 @BarbaraJWalters @theviewtv will apologize to me just like she did when I was right about @Rosie. Besides, I get great ratings on The View.
261508529662357504 @BarbaraJWalters @theviewtv Barbara, unfortunately you've missed the entire point of my announcement--you just don't get it!
261506691567329280 Still waiting for an explanation about why @GiulianaRancic & @BillRancic did not name their son Donald. Unbelievable.
261504858790707200 Miss Universe 2012 Pageant will be airing live on @nbc & @Telemundo december 19th. Open invite stands for Robert Pattinson.
261504170660614144 Excited to announce that @GiulianaRancic & @BravoAndy will be hosting the 2012 Miss Universe Pageant. Great ratings for Miss Universe.
261501761049747458 How does @michellemalkin get a conservative platform? She is a dummy--just look at her past.
261496865835581441 I am happy to have started #ObamasFavoriteCharity. Really enjoying reading everyone's tweets.
261496596536102913 My @gretawire interview discussing my $5M charitable offer to Obama, his lack of transparency & my tremendous support

261451098815070208 Trump offers $5 million for Obama college, passport records By @AlexPappasDC @DailyCaller
261227744522821633 Just stated by a total pro: You are the only one who has the guts to say what we are all thinking.
261224390719590400 Glad to hear North Carolina is solid for @MittRomney. It started trending for Mitt solidly after my speech at the @NCGOP convention.
261222952010395649 In light the Benghazi emails released last night, it is apparent that Obama has no problem lying to the American public...
261222827871567872 ... By releasing his records, he can come clean with the American people and have $5 million go to a charity.
261221579399245825 Obama has no problem leaking national security secrets. Why can't he release his records? Especially when $5M is going to charity.
261221279728824324 I am happy to donate $5 million to a charity Barack Obama chooses. All I am asking is that he is transparent with the American people
261220234470502400 I just learned that @politico has no credibility--total phonies that don't report the truth. A puppet of Obama?
261218528206667777 Glad to hear @seanhannity supports my offer to Obama. As Sean says it is an easy $5 million to charity. What does Obama have to lose?
261218218503458817 Third rate @politico took every negative tweet or response they could find & put it out--when in fact the response is incredibly positive.
261217157319389185 My offer to Obama is about transparency. In 2008, American people were sold on hope and change. This our last chance to get the full record.
261192751935279104 Virtually all Presidents and candidates including John McCain, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush...
261147459739336705 The response has been fantastic--- actually overwhelming! Thank you!
261138885466267648 As stated, here is the press release.
261135442034950144 You have all been waiting-- the response has been amazing! Watch my announcement now, press release to follow at 12:15.
261094759320408064 All predictions re: my 12 o'clock release are totally incorrect. Stay tuned!
261094409330905088 Story will be released today at 12 noon EST on Twitter and Facebook.

260843113231306752 No wonder @BBC is in such big trouble & boss was just fired--they are lost.
260842893772738560 @BBC should never have played that piece of garbage documentary--& yet the phones are ringing off the hook to play the course.
260842669843038210 ...that it was hard not to end up rooting for Trump...
260842555070115841 Thank you to @DailyTelegraph reviewer @NeilMidgley who stated 'You've Been Trumped' was so biased in favour of the protesters...
260831202452328448 @bobschieffer did an excellent job as debate moderator last night. I only wish Mitt was more aggressive!
260814133690249217 Everyone is asking me to speak more on Robert & Kristen.I don't have time except to say Robert, drop her, she cheated on you & will again!
260810521421414400 Last night was the first time Obama said we instead of I in respect to Bin Laden's killing.
260807345070813184 Barack Obama said absolutely not 3 times before he agreed to go after Bin Laden--- now he wants all of the credit!
260805521542619136 My announcement is tomorrow!
260805179161575426 Tomorrow I will be tweeting on only one subject!
260790972236038144 China will never go to war with us because if they won they would only take over property they already own!
260785324421152768 Mitt Romney must start congratulating the Navy Seals and military on Bin Laden's killing, not the President.
260783119853056001 @MittRomney should have been more aggressive last night. Yet some polls have him winning the debate.
260781473760686080 My @SquawkCNBC interview discussing last night's presidential debate, my stock picks and tomorrow's big announcement

260773314291720192 When the military informed Obama that they had Bin Laden, is there anyone with a brain that would not have said Ok, go get him?

260744683075035136 No matter what happens in the election, @davidaxelrod deserves a lot of credit. He has kept Obama in it, even with his terrible record.
260734729341530112 I always said that @lancearmstrong had to keep fighting the charges. By stopping, he gave his enemies an opening.
260726937352290304 70% of the Chinese say they are better off than they were 4 years ago At least someone has done well under Obama.
260700788563795969 The debate was pretty even but I thought Mitt should have been much more aggressive on Obama's failed foreign policy-- and I mean much more.
260700414381547520 Debate was somewhat hard to watch last night. Viewership will be way down.
260700264909135872 I will be doing @SquawkCNBC at 7:30.
260549166776852480 Stop congratulating Obama for killing Bin Laden. The Navy Seals killed Bin Laden. #debate
260548584582287360 @MittRomney looks much calmer, and Obama should stop nodding his head backwards and forward.
260546105601830912 Bob Schieffer will do a great job tonight. Always treated me fairly.
260535782324981760 Well this is it, the final debate- let's see how it goes. I'll be tweeting live.
260494546318807040 Former Obama White House economic adviser @Austan_Goolsbee gave his old boss a 'C' on the economy Pretty generous!
260490972465598464 Why don't we ask the Navy SEALs who killed Bin Laden? They don't seem to be happy with Obama claiming credit. All he did is say O.K.
260488335003377664 I look forward to @MittRomney hitting Obama hard tonight for lying about Benghazi. CIA told Obama it was a terrorist attack after 24 hrs.
260487521430040576 Everybody is asking about my announcement this Wednesday concerning Barack Obama---just wait and see!
260482827458592768 Everyone knows I am right that Robert Pattinson should dump Kristen Stewart. In a couple of years, he will thank me. Be smart, Robert.
260482423668740098 Obama is an easy target on foreign policy@MittRomney has many openings to attack, especially when Obama starts bragging about Bin Laden.
260481886097383424 This is my last election. After my election I have more flexibility. Obama to @MedvedevRussiaE discussing our nuclear arsenal.
260475529646456832 Obama planted that @nytimes story on Iran so it will be discussed in tonight's debate. He wants Libya and China off the table.
260468137919660032 The brass in #TRUMP Tower's atrium is polished twice a month like clockwork. I keep the atrium impeccable. Key to its success!
260462708414103552 @Toure I felt very sorry for you during your meltdown on @PiersMorgan. He drove you insane but, of course, Piers is a lot smarter than you
260456759183945728 My son Don and his wife Vanessa just had a beautiful baby boy named Spencer Frederick --very thrilling.
260426687303532544 I wish tonight's debate would cover more than foreign policy.
260421157201784832 Don't let Obama play the Iran card in order to start a war in order to get elected--be careful Republicans!
260417626663182337 @Toure, when you are fired from MSNBC for your bad ratings and racist coverage, stop by and say hello.
260415099452416000 Autism rates through the roof--why doesn't the Obama administration do something about doctor-inflicted autism. We lose nothing to try.

260389201638481920 Obama should stop talking about wind turbines--they are a disaster for a country or community & are very expensive & unreliable.

259372736730787842 Maybe Derek Jeter should ask A-Rod about renting his apartment next year. Very soon A-Rod won't need a place in NYC.

259031638380527616 @crazymom28 I have a friend that wants to meet your sister.
259030677880721408 My Trump Home Mattress Collection by Serta is setting records--they are really phenomenal. You can order them at
259027449445232640 The last time I visited China I couldn't believe all the construction. You can go up with a project in a week--no red tape.
259019547007393793 It's Thursday. How much money did Barack Obama waste today on crony green energy projects?
259012383824039936 Clinton commented in Ohio today that @MittRomney is right, the economy has not been fixed under Obama.I always said Bill was an honest man.
259010855616790529 When Strasburg leaves @Nationals for another team for more money, will Washington still like the decision to shut him down for his good?
259008783433469953 Bad sign for Obama's campaign now publicly admitting they are focused on 4 states. Their internals must be horrendous.
258991575416307713 While the next season of @CelebApprentice is packed w/ All Stars, ours fans will be happy to see @Joan_Rivers in the board room.She is back!
258990675863941122 Derek Jeter @yankees wants to rent an apartment. Derek--only in a Trump building--Trump is lucky for you.
258971144936361985 Now there is talk of A-Rod being shipped to @Marlins. If A-Rod is not a @yankee next year, the fans will be happy.
258970589853786113 I think the @yankees will win today. Unlike A-Rod, CC is good under pressure. I hope A-Rod plays, however.
258966137302315009 Robert I'm getting a lot of heat for saying you should dump Kristen- but I'm right. If you saw the Miss Universe girls you would reconsider.
258964691697676288 @G_Harwood Because they are either jealous or losers (or both).
258960049387474944 A reader just sent me the following: I wanted to share with you something rather startling. On page 103 of (cont)

258941775257931776 @womenzbinder Check the records, dummy--I was never a Bush II fan--he is why we have Obama!
258939591418077185 @antbaxter @MailOnline They only suffered by watching your 3rd rate documentary (which bombed).
258937466155831297 Lots of response to my Pattinson/Kristen Stewart reunion. She will cheat again--100 certain--am I ever wrong?
258934211573063681 Looking forward to honoring the great Dogan family & the success of the Trump Towers project in Istanbul @FollowTurkey Annual Gala Dinner
258917220846018560 Alert--US jobless claims up 46,000 to 388,000. Really bad news. 7.8% is now a fraud--not possible!
258916850291834880 Amazing--my tweets are covered across every spectrum from @espn to @politico to @WSJ.
258910260406939648 When we're talking about math that doesn't add up, how about $5 trillion of deficits over the last four years. --@MittRomney
258909724983042048 Obama's spending and borrowing is burying America and destroying our children's future. Does he even care?
258674180550184960 #SuccessByTrump, exclusively available @Macy's, has set sale records for fastest selling cologne. Makes a great gift
258673336391966722 Great--now Supreme Court Justices are talking about a constitutional right to a cell phone Obama, just stop already.
258671417581780992 @ashleycam2883 Re: Libya--Hillary took the blame for Obama.
258669445763969024 Mitt's proposed tax cuts for the middle class will spur record economic growth.

258661851972386816 Under his administration, oil and gas production on public land is down over 10% Obama did not tell truth last night.
258661128643674112 If Obama goes after Mitt's private sector experience in the next debate then Mitt should ask for Obama's college records--all of them.
258658751857438721 @mystikangel Bring @johnrich back? He is back!
258657182176927744 @antbaxter should really be ashamed about his massive box office disaster. Take a hint and get out of the film (cont)
258655569458651136 @dubephnx If we didn't remove incredibly powerful fire retardant asbestos & replace it with junk that doesn't (cont)
258645188120027136 What is never said is that people take a big risk with their money and can lose it all. We should be given credit for taking this risk.
258642133098049536 Can you imagine how embarrassing it would have been for the country if the candidates actually did get into a fist fight?
258640349872926720 Robert Pattinson should not take back Kristen Stewart. She cheated on him like a dog & will do it again--just watch. He can do much better!
258638570028404737 Michael Vick of the Philadelphia @eagles is a great athlete but not a great quarterback.
258637296222474240 Initial reports say 2nd debate viewership dropped. See what happens when I am not mentioned.
258636725893623808 Just read about my friend @HulkHogan--he was set up--too bad he has to use the court system instead of his muscles.
258636047519453184 @BillRancic Bill- You should have named your beautiful son Donald.
258632006932496384 Joe Girardi @Yankees must play his starters, even A-Rod, they got you there.
258631311458181120 While the @Yankees look like they quit and are finished, they won't quit for CC
258630587487772672 Last Saturday A-Rod was 0-3 and left 6 stranded. But he was still hitting on girls from the dugout He is very selfish!
258611949053571072 Obama talks about what he is going to do--why the hell didn't he just do it, especially in the first 2 years when he had all votes necessary
258609030858170369 @MittRomney scored last night on both substance and style.
258608142324232193 Trump Was Right: 'Obama's America' Tops 2012 Documentaries via @Newsmax_Media
258607392978268160 ...Bad decisions can be devastating.
258607232323829760 Obama was beaten but not knocked out. He lives to fight another day. But in the real world presidents are not given a second chance...
258603416547381248 All the guys that said @MittRomney would lose are rapidly coming on board. Mitt will remember the early helpers.
258596503420010496 If Obama keeps pushing wind turbines our country will go down the tubes economically, environmentally & aesthetically.
258596208350748672 Robert Bryce @NYPost--Congrats on your great opinion piece on terrible wind turbines & how destructive they are. Windmills are a disaster.
258593090107998208 Remember, new environment friendly lightbulbs can cause cancer. Be careful-- the idiots who came up with this stuff don't care.
258591443256475648 Wind turbines are not only killing millions of birds, they are killing the finances & environment of many countries & communities.
258591247743205376 Great article on wind turbines by Robert Bryce in today's @NYPost
258589709608034304 Really enjoyed discussing @yankees yesterday with @RealMicihaelKay. I am a long time Yankee fan.
258589119167475714 Via @espn: Donald Trump would fire A-Rod
258586450256355329 My interview with @RealMichaelKay discussing why A-Rod should be fired from @yankees & how to terminate his contract
258585127276392449 My twitter followers will soon be over 2 million--& all the biggies. It's like having your own newspaper.
258584864163500033 My twitter has become so powerful that I can actually make my enemies tell the truth.
258575681275965440 Polls are starting to look really bad for Obama. Looks like he'll have to start a war or major conflict to win. Don't put it past him!
258572492044660737 Obama did much better than he did last time--but still lost decisively.
258572175634743296 Do you believe Barack Hussein Obama (aka Barry Soetoro) looked like a president last night? I don't!
258566974085423104 Obama has zero credibility on oil and coal. If we do not win energy as a country, we just do not win, period!
258566750071824384 I still love Derek, he is a winner!
258566665388843009 Remember, I said Derek don't sell your Trump World Tower apartment...its been lucky for you. The day after he sold it, he broke his foot.
258565793749544961 At the debate, the President kept talking of what he is going to do. I kept saying, why didn't he do it? He lost me a long time ago.
258564445238853632 Verlander pitched great, but @Yankees look truly defeated.
258544552179269633 Stupid George Will gave @MittRomney no chance 3 months ago. Take off his little spectacles and he's just another dummy.
258542382667149312 George Will said best debate he ever saw. If you ever heard George Will speak(boring) anything is exciting.
258538212308447232 Debate showed--- these guys really hate each other. At one point it looked like they would come to blows.Ã
258399470440546306 Obama better than last time, but again, @MittRomney wins. Good night. #debate
258394846191054849 You talk tough, Mr. President, but have done nothing about China killing our jobs and economy.
258392659385802752 Such long rhetorical and boring answers from Obama. No wonder nothing gets done.
258391266109292544 @MittRomney much better on Libya and Middle East problems. Obama has no answer.
258389970090340353 Obama keeps namedropping Bill Clinton-- he is no Bill Clinton.
258389924456312832 Obama weak on immigration. All words, no action. He's been Prez 4 years.
258382694520586240 Obama is looking rhetorical and weak. @MittRomney is looking strong and sharp.
258381269258338306 Obama just said @MittRomney was a very successful investor--- big mistake for Obama to admit- he has less and less credibility.
258378469950513152 Obama keeps saying that he will do something--- but why hasn't he done it? It's all talk.
258378264677060609 @MittRomney looks much stronger and much more Presidential!
258375096064950273 Then how come gasoline is hitting record high prices?
258374127688232960 Good response on jobs by @MittRomney.
258373635822215168 Why has Obama let China and others take our jobs?
258373566196768771 Why hasn't Obama created jobs?
258368306203987968 Getting ready to watch the debate--- as they say let's get ready to rumble!
258320714967416832 I was just told by one of the top @PGATOUR players that my golf courses are the most elite in the country. Very nice compliment--I agree.
258318014334767104 We should be able to negotiate a deal with Iran because they know we could blow them away to the Stone Age.They just don't believe we would.
258317021505282048 @drumline_mormon It is selling great at Macy's--thanks!
258314355127513088 For political purposes only, Obama is planning to hit Libya for the Benghazi embassy attack right before the election?
258312283325857793 Great win last night by Peyton Manning & @Denver_Broncos in San Diego coming from 24 points behind on the road. Very impressive.
258311801484226560 If the @yankees can somehow beat Verlander tonight then they can still salvage the series. And I will go to games 6& 7 so they will win!
258310790619201537 Get ready for tonight!
258307558513721347 @MissUSA Olivia--we love you. You are doing a great job.
258299167355588608 @MittRomney--if Obama gets wise tonight just ask for his college records & transcripts--he will quiet down quickly.
258287176633180160 Good luck @MittRomney tonight--have no doubt you will be great.
258278407324987392 Congratulations to @JamesOKeefeIII on exposing more Democrat voter fraud. @DNC was caught red handed telling people to vote twice.
258277938389196801 I bet the terrorists in Libya used weapons we supplied them during their so called 'revolution' to attack our embassy in Benghazi.
258274048629424129 @washtimes @BrettMDecker: Five Questions w/ @realDonaldTrump--'Lack of Leadership is the biggest threat to America'
258271235174187009 Between Libya, the national security leaks and Fast & Furious, Obama has had more national security scandals than any other President.
258270168029995008 @reince is doing a fantastic job for the Republican Party--hope he gets the credit he deserves.
258266414501212160 @antbaxter I tried watching but fell asleep.
258264740126658560 @History's wonderful The Men Who Built America with me on tonight at 9 -- bad timing, I'll be live tweeting the debate
258263681945706496 Because Obama was so pathetic in the first debate, tonight's audience will be humongous--people want to see if he is for real.
258262904091058176 The Coca Cola company is not happy with me--that's okay, I'll still keep drinking that garbage.
258251332165713920 It's amazing--my weekly scheduled interviews on @foxnews and @CNBC draw the highest ratings. And they get bigger week by week--thanks folks!
258241361386561536 Obama just had another trillion dollar budget deficit for the fourth year in a row. At least he is consistent.
258230257893666816 Diet Coke tweet had a monster response--dammit, I wish the stuff worked.
258223698098655234 @antbaxter Thanks for helping promote & make Trump International Golf Links Scotland so successful--you stupid fool!
258223356241928193 @antbaxter Your documentary died many deaths. You have, in my opinion, zero talent.
258213414252453888 I can confirm the reports--@BillRancic, my first season winner, will be returning to this All-Star season of @CelebApprentice.
258212561596579840 @rupertmurdoch is absolutely right, it will be a nightmare for @Israel if Obama is re-elected.
258208796839657472 Verlander is great but very beatable. Does not have a good ERA in playoff games
258207708644249600 I turned down going to the debate tonight so that I could do live tweets to my many followers.
258205151507124224 I have no doubt that Mitt will do really well tonight. We'll all be watching @MittRomney.
258204040503128065 Lots of pressure on Obama tonight--even more than A-Rod. If he doesn't perform well it could be over.
258200612871753729 I hope A-Rod has a great night for the Yankees--he owes it to them--especially with Derek hurt.
258193260760150016 Gov. Gary Johnson pulling votes from @MittRomney--Don't waste your vote. Obama must go!

257955447544352768 Sometimes the best thing you can do is just let things ride, let time go by.
257944234517221376 If @MittRomney has a good debate tomorrow night, Obama is finished!
257943323799613442 Obama is planning on attacking Romney on Bain in tomorrow's debate Mitt should bring up college applications & records
257936689614450688 Romney, Ryan Slam Obama Administration on China Currency Manipulation via @ABC
257936201057705984 Once again Obama fails to classify China as a currency manipulator. He just helped China steal even more jobs and money from us.
257930053776732160 A-Rod should donate his contract to charity. He doesn't make the @yankees any money and he doesn't perform. He is a $30M/yr rip off.
257925839902085120 Looking forward to speaking at tonight's gala for @MittRomney supporters at the Intrepid. Mitt's doing well.
257887990905466880 Barack Obama is not who you think he is. Most overrated politician in US history.
257887477984022528 Isn't it time that Obama release his college records and applications? Boy would that create a mess! He is not who you think.
257879227930648577 Lots of response to my comment on Diet Coke-Ã let's face it, it doesn't work- just makes you hungry.
257861120604397569 A-Rod was a great player when he lived at Trump Park Avenue--- even though he was on the juice!
257858283564593154 Derek Jeter had a great career until 3 days ago when he sold his apartment at Trump World Tower- I told him not to sell- karma?
257845928248086529 I love @LibertyUniversity--such great people!
257841894015500288 A-Rod is just not making it. We want to give him a chance but it was only drugs that made him great.
257668238710820864 Obama will be trying very hard at next debate- he doesn't want to lose the Boeing.
257663638708563968 Who says Obama will do better in the next debate- has he gotten smarter in 2 weeks!
257657113185230849 @MittRomney's poll numbers are looking really good. One more great debate performance and it will be a total knockout.Ã
257552283850653696 I have never seen a thin person drinking Diet Coke.
257552110374248448 No, I wasn't at the @Yankees game yesterday- can't go today either. When I go, they win.
257547904984694785 Brooklyn Nets have the worst uniform ever- Boring- won't matter if they win(Winning solves all problems- (cont)
257522310481854465 Yankees can win today. Kuroda is a highly underrated pitcher.
257521719361798144 A-Rod hit ball hard first at bat. Time for him to step up and leave.
257483280641839104 Swisher should have caught ball in right field last night.
257475759629815809 @Yankees are in trouble without Derek. Try A-Rod at short- get him some confidence.
257468145424551936 A bad thing finally happened to Derek Jeter--- he is a great champion.
257293284945321985 So much for Washington shutting down Strasburg- they deserved to lose.
257227013293756416 Roadway steel on beautiful Verrazano-Narrows Bridge is rusting and rotting away. Scrape and paint before too late.
257193606895521793 Tonight, despite everything, put A-Rod in the lineup.Ã
257189181007220736 Everyone's wondering what's wrong with A-Rod. Not one sports writer blames it on his not being able to use drugs anymore-- the real reason.Ã
257173482905935872 They found Jessica in Colorado--- body was mutilated--- death to the pervert killer.
257143158276759552 Joe Girardi did a great job of managing the Yankees this series.
257140638523486208 I'll bet Obama goes down just like Washington because he doesn't use our(this country's) best people to win.
257136910600896513 Washington should have brought in Strasburg to relieve-- they would have won.
257122019831844864 When Strasburg leaves in a couple of years under free agency Washington will say what were we doing.
256912686997196800 I told you, whenever I go to a @Yankees game the @Yankees win.
256852657069756417 Leadership is the capacity to translate vision into reality. -- Warren G. Bennis
256848991294197760 When an employee leaves me and begs to come back--I never let them. Loyalty is very important.
256844944466128897 I look forward to Tuesday night's presidential debate--I wonder if Obama will use my name again.
256840570012577796 Very different styles but each totally effective in his own way at the debate.
256836413914488832 What we are watching on our TV screens is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy. --@PaulRyanVP
256832383834275840 Obama's economic policies are causing inflation on hard working families. The price of corn alone has risen over 200% since he was elected.
256829893529202688 With our amazing All Star cast, @Joan_Rivers, @johnrich, @ArsenioOFFICIAL & @piersmorgan are also returning as boardroom advisors.
256827434412961792 Great to hear that our loyal @CelebApprentice fans are happy with today's announcement of the new cast. This will be something special!
256825010667270144 @dennisrodman looks like he really cleaned up his act.
256823035716325376 I'm going to the @Yankees game tonight to root them on--they always win when I am there.
256820259061919749 My Scotland course is receiving accolades from all over the world--a great honor for me.
256802697607512066 Credibility is important to me- hence must admit that both candidates did really well last night. #VPDebate
256800191838052352 Doing the @todayshow with @MLauer was great- I really like Matt.
256781462060273665 First Minister of Scotland released bomber of Pan Am flight #103 on compassionate grounds. Do you believe?
256763248274198529 There are many ways of going forward, but only one way of standing still. -- Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt
256757082320146433 @dennisrodman @ApprenticeNBC Great to have you back for the best season yet!
256752629068226560 ObamaCare is a complete disaster. Many of my friends have to scale down their businesses because they can't afford it. Terrible.
256747611934040064 Wing bangers-- the name given to wind turbines by bird lovers for the thousands of birds they kill in the U.S.
256739203411476480 British PM Cameron is making a fool of himself by wasting billions of pounds on unwanted & environment destroying Scottish windmills.
256710012196507648 Going over to @TodayShow now to introduce @ApprenticeNBC cast etc.-- watch.
256584882434748416 Pretty even debate- no knockouts. However Ryan's closing statement somewhat stronger. What do you think? #VPDebate
256571678237282304 Biden's statements on Medicare are very effective. Ryan must now come back and combat. #VPDebate
256567241573818368 Excellent story on @MittRomney- very good moment for Ryan. #VPDebate
256566001385209856 Biden's sarcastic smiling may or may not be effective depending on who is watching. #VPDebate
256563171207294976 Hard for Biden to justify Libya mess but doing best he can. #VPDebate
256560945898352640 Both candidates are looking sharp- now it's up to the mouth and the mind. #VPDebate
256558418876325888 Get ready- this should be informative and fun! #VPDebate
256534982263193600 Looking forward to the debate tonight and will be tweeting live with very honest assessment.
256503294657191938 @Linda_McMahon is an elite businesswoman who will bring a great outlook to DC. Support her campaign here
256488097443897344 Another sign that @jack_welch is right. New government labor report casts even more doubt on the September jobs data
256487311515209728 Why does Barack Obama's ring have an arabic inscription? Who is this guy?
256486209034022914 It's Thursday and only 26 days until the election. How many illegal donations from China and Saudi Arabia did Obama collect today?
256484294871113729 So Obama used to tell classmates that he was Kenyan royalty and an Indonesian prince Sounds like his book bio!
256483626026426368 Our foreign policy decisions are dumbest in U.S. history
256483185901309952 Live tweeting during tonight's VP debate...should be a great time
256477624430370816 How the hell does the Libyan government get off telling our embassy security they can't have loaded guns for protection?!
256477082228518914 Why the hell did we help the Libyan rebels in the first place. That is the real scandal.
256467122610376704 Outright disgusting--the Obama administration has continually stonewalled and lied to US Amb. Sean Smith's mother
256466457968381955 I suspect @JoeBiden could do well tonight. Don't be fooled by his gaffes. He is a seasoned and feisty debater.
256454471020847105 If @rihanna is dating @chrisbrown again then she has a death wish. A beater is always a beater--just watch!
256437756107034624 Amazing that Derek Jeter played with an injury throughout most of last night's @yankees game and did so well.
256433674348793856 $30M a year and A-Rod is now relegated to the bench. @yankees would have lost if Girardi hadn't benched him in the 9th (see my prediction)
256427440346374145 I guess they have Lance Armstrong cold. Brutal report. A waste of taxpayer money to take down an American hero.
256424576693710848 @Apprenticenbc cast will be announced tomorrow at 7:30am ET on the @todayshow with @MLauer
256422607455395840 Staff at Trump Park Avenue disliked A-Rod--to put it mildly -- The staff at Trump World Tower loves Derek Jeter.
256421813972770816 Asking why my dislike of A-Rod--dishonorable dealings with me on an apartment deal
256420333274406912 Great move to take A-Rod out of game. Now terminate his contract based on misrepresentation (drugs).
256378669763788801 When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it. -- Henry Ford
256133095034601472 Must read article on Obama's illegal fundraising from abroad Foreign candidate getting foreign donations.
256132205242355712 I enjoy meeting tourists in #TrumpTower. People travel from across the world to see the five-level Atrium & waterfall.
256128818807447552 Congratulations to @FLGovScott on getting an A grade from @CatoInstitute on his fiscal policy. Rick is a fantastic governor.
256127187894300672 Even with lower profit projections, American firms are still throwing money into China Obama is killing investment.
256125913694089216 I am more concerned about Biden in the debate than I am about Obama. Be careful on Thursday night!
256123695955857409 You have to scratch your head when the president spends the last week talking about saving Big Bird. -- @MittRomney
256118540397080578 Consumer spending fell in September Another indicator the 7.8% unemployment number is cooked.
256117820495126528 A-Rod must be dropped in the Yankees line-up tonight if they want to win. He simply can't perform without drugs.
256113180252729346 Obama was guest at VP debate moderator Martha Raddatz's wedding Do people think this is fair?
256111919491084288 Receiving thousands of thank you letters from @LibertyU students for my convocation speech. The honor was all mine! Great people.
256104783763603457 DELUSIONAL--Obama actually thought that he won the debate What is he thinking?
256104065287733248 47M on food stamps. Over 23M Americans unemployed. 50% of college grads unemployed. And Obama wants us talking about Big Bird.
256092879401934850 Has Barack Obama been caught red handed laundering money into his campaign from illegal online foreign donations? Media?
256078510467215360 I just had to fire someone, he didn't have a clue--he reminded me of Obama on Wednesday night.
256072913789284352 27 days until America's greatest test since our founding. In this election, we decide whether we become great again.
256063573669855232 It doesn't matter who you vote for--it matters who is counting the votes. Be careful of voter fraud!
256056387203911681 Obama is under a great of pressure to perform well in the next debate. Let's see how he reacts under pressure.
256055143064289282 Remember, Obama limped across the finish line--he should have lost to Hillary. Be careful!
256044871482220544 I don't think Obama will do well in the second debate--he is psyched out just like A-Rod.
256042093930242048 I will implement effective missile defenses to protect against threats. On this, there will be no flexibility with Vladimir Putin. -- Mitt
256031437160054784 By popular request I will also be tweeting live during the Vice Presidential debate Thursday night. It will be very interesting, I promise.
256023423829032960 @DavidLetterman @Late_Show fully apologized last night for calling me a racist. Thank you David--we are again friends.
255791437260656641 The public is about to learn a lot more information on Barack Obama and his true background in the coming weeksÃ¢Â¦
255784560904773633 Now that Obama's poll numbers are in tailspin Ã¢ watch for him to launch a strike in Libya or Iran. He is desperate.
255777551828545537 Mitt's subsequent rise in the polls post-debate shows that the American public can still spot a real winner.
255770772101009408 In order to build your wealth and improve your business smarts, you need to know about real estate. - Think Like a Billionaire
255766290885656576 With these record high gas prices, what does it say about Obama that he was trying to brag about his energy policy in the debate?
255738703052435456 Looking forward to live tweeting during the rest of the debates. Will be a lot of fun.
255736699982864384 When will the unemployment numbers be corrected? Sadly, after the election!
255729217617141760 Donald Trump: Ã¢Monkey business' on jobs via @politico
255725221426909184 George Will is a political moron. Last month he said Romney couldn't win.
255721242101940224 In the end, Andy Pettitte did not rat out his friend Roger Clemens. I like him again, a lot.
255720069768826880 Drop A-Rod in the order and cut his salary based on unreported drug use. Also, not a pressure player.
255717928316583937 My @SquawkCNBC #TRUMPTUESDAY interview discussing the upcoming debates, the real state of unemployment & bias media
255717302413172736 Why isn't Obama protecting us from ridiculous gas prices?
255717123442229249 California gas prices going thru the roof, others to follow. An election-losing event for Obama.
255692718448197633 Greece should get out of the euro & go back to their own currency--they are just wasting time.
255690799193415680 @ErraticSLK Shout out = work hard!
255684651203559424 @carlosbeltran15 is playing great for St. Louis Cardinals. They made a wise decision.
255680998069633025 @jack_welch is correct--these reporters would not have been so brave while Jack was running GE.
255678963056246784 Our many loyal viewers should expect a major announcement very soon on next season's @CelebApprentice. Our fans will be pleased.
255671869951328256 Sleepy eyes @chucktodd -- whenever you mention me unfairly I will likewise mention you.
255670162068488192 Obama projected a 2012 budget deficit of $557B. It is actually double that at $1.1T We can't afford four more years.
255410932937785346 Obama's planned tax hike will hit over 1 million small businesses Expect more massive unemployment and stagnant growth
255397854347157505 How long did it take for Obama to call Hugo Chavez and congratulate him on his 'reelection?' Who do you think Chavez supports in ours?
255396685671444480 Congratulations to @drewbrees on setting the @NFL record with 48 consecutive games with a TD pass. He is a great guy and player.
255395992877273088 At the request of many- I will be doing live tweets during the next presidential debate.
255392008695316480 Sleepy eyes @chucktodd is an absolute joke of a reporter. He is in the bag for Obama. He can't carry @jack_welch's jock.
255390140845940737 Who is more believable on the state of employment--the great @jack_welch or some government bureaucrat who is voting for Obama?
255380750508126208 A record 46.68M Americans are now on food stamps Four more years?
255370164017721344 I would do same thing if I were China. They want Obama.
255348583618985984 My @foxandfriends interview discussing Obama's failed and dangerous foreign policy and the real unemployment numbers
255294883680632833 Got to do something about these missing chidlren grabbed by the perverts. Too many incidents--fast trial, death penalty.
254319736974893056 More than 70M people watched the Presidential Debate. A new record. See what happens when I am so prominently mentioned (just kidding)!
254314363127738368 Looking forward to Sunday's speech in the ExCel Centre.
254302656774950915 The team with the best players wins. -- @jack_welch
254296606717911040 @acuconservative's #CPACCO kept up the momentum from the debate. @MittRomney even made a surprise appearance. Now go win CO!
254289618760003584 Now America knows--the Emperor has no clothes. Why would Obama do better in a 2nd debate? #Debate #Obama
254281529969238016 My friend @GovChristie called it--@MittRomney recast the race.
254261716504961024 Glad to hear that @RobinRoberts is doing well. She is a terrific person.
254260863966531584 I promise to do a new #trumpvlog when I get back next week---- lots of requests. Thanks!

253944806739439616 Scary & Unsustainable: On Monday the US added more debt than from 1776 through Pearl Harbor
253938102417117184 Mr. President, you're entitled as the president to your own airplane and to your own house, but not to your own facts. --@MittRomney
253930695955730432 Bill Clinton has been Obama's most effective surrogate out on the trail.
253930461410238464 Congrats to @Yankees on finishing 1st in the AL East. Derek Jeter is great--good luck in the playoffs!
253928559834447872 I'll be in London on Sunday at the ExCel Centre to talk about success. It will be a great time for everyone!
253925292207398912 @HighTide1989 Amazing is good too.
253922532086935552 @LuLuCornbread @celebapprentice Most likely in February.
253917441497907200 The upcoming season of @CelebApprentice will be terrific--a great cast.
253913912544722944 Now another Obama speech from 2002 with him talking about taking the rich's 'stuff' Who is this guy? Where's the media?
253883107294449666 Congratulations to Michelle and Barack Obama on their 20th anniversary.
253880120576716801 Happy to have just passed 1.5M followers on twitter. We picked up over 14,000 yesterday alone. It's great to speak to everyone daily.
253877445814525952 I'm eagerly awaiting the next polls. The debate performance could be devastating to the Obama team. Let's see what happens.
253873730126753792 @FSTLTD @tonyrobbins Will be a great event. See you in London.
253864404897128452 Both being optimistic and remembering the big picture have served me well throughout my life. You need to stay positive.
253856844534120448 @SethMacFarlane will be a great Oscar host. He did an amazing job at my @ComedyCentral roast.
253847285853724672 Wind farms are ugly, not cost effective and don't produce worthwhile returns or energy. No wonder governments are giving up on them.
253694168164102147 As a big job creator, I was greatly honored to have been mentioned twice tonight during the debate.
253693930670002177 Congratulations to Mitt Romney. He was not only good, he was absolutely fantastic tonight!
253599772227809280 Invincibility lies in the defence; the possibility of victory in the attack. --Sun Tzu
253598240602214400 There's only one candidate who cut medicare and that's Barack Obama. Cut over $700M to move into ObamaCare.
253590315443818497 In August, 2012, Obama said the so called Arab Spring sprung from 'joyful longing for human freedom' Good call!
253587791454294017 Have you heard? China just told Obama to jump. Obama asked how high.
253581368087437312 Obama's '07 speech which @DailyCaller just released not only shows that Obama is a racist but also how the press always covers for him.
253577503849984000 I'm always amazed when I travel to my foreign properties.Seeing the Trump brand across 4 continents proves that excellence can be universal.
253571648131846145 @escobedoantonio Work hard and never give up!
253570341471932416 I will be visiting Trump Int'l Golf Links in Scotland tomorrow. Always great to see the Great Dunes of Scotland.
253567297984274432 Who is rooting for Obama more tonight--his campaign advisors or the press?
253566581387440129 Can't wait for tonight's debate--actually delayed my trip to Europe so I can watch. This is going to be a great night.
253566232098373632 My @gretawire interview discussing @MittRomney debate responses, Obama's hidden records, my tweets and unemployment
253563388402208769 I am very proud of Ivanka!
253562547985338368 My daughter Ivanka is being honored by the Wharton School of Finance with the 2012 Young Leadership Award. Also (cont)
253534879986376704 @DavidRoyEarle See you in London--big crowd!
253519625709576193 Reverend Wright must have great hatred for Obama and the manner in which he was shunted aside.
253516010974507008 Obama called Reverend Wright his friend, counselor & great leader--then dumped him like a dog!
253513620334460928 See June 2007 speech--is Obama a total racist?
253499205283360768 Congratulations to Barack Obama for having 2012's debt already surpass 2011
253488938264715264 The cheap 12 inch sq. marble tiles behind speaker at UN always bothered me. I will replace with beautiful large marble slabs if they ask me.
253485490605531136 Where is the main stream media reporting on Univision's new expose of Fast and Furious? Too busy looking at Mitt's taxes?
253485069983956992 Major Mexican cartel boss El Diego was just arrested with weapons provided to him through Fast and Furious Media??
253482871292039169 A great article about how ObamaCare has even further complicated the tax code and will hurt housing market
253238263555440640 @ritter1025 Wishing your wife a Happy Birthday
253234773403779072 It's Tuesday, how much will the media continue to cover up the embassy attacks for Obama?
253231150535942144 I'll be on @gretawire tonight on @foxnews at 10 pm.
253227344943263744 Great to hear that @nfl legend and hall of famer John Elway has endorsed @MittRomney in Colorado. CO is a must win state for Mitt.
253213918938415105 Under Obama, Iran has taken over Iraq, Al Qaeda has taken over Libya, the Muslim Brotherhood now controls Egypt. Worst foreign policy ever.
253209744246976515 Woody Johnson's comments that he would rather have @MittRomney win the election than his @nyjets win games shows real patriotism.
253206663664922624 The Chinese are now hacking White House computers. Why not? They already own the place.
253204068514791425 Big win by @Yankees last night to take control of AL East. Jeter & company now control their destiny.
253203137551278081 Wednesday's debate is day one of the election. Over 70 million voters will be watching.
253202143702560768 In Nov. '11, Al Qaeda's flag flew over the 'birthplace' of Libya's revolution In Sept. '12 it flew over our Embassy.
253198092998946816 Glad to hear @SethMacFarlane will be hosting this year's Oscars. Something new that should be fun.
253180850085187584 A clip from @KatieShow where I take @katiecouric's audience on the Katie Coach
253179289149767680 My @SquawkCNBC #TrumpTuesday interview discussing how @MittRomney can win the first debate & the last 35 days
253159766057181184 If Obama mentions Mitt's tax returns in tomorrow's debate then Mitt should immediately ask for Obama's college records & applications
253151034883588096 Obama is trying to block sequester layoff notices in Virginia Another example of sleazy politics!
253146023004872704 Threatening phone calls from Obama supporters are being made to the Michigan GOP office Don't be intimidated!
253144495737143296 Obama loves wasting our money. He just made another guarantee of $197M to a solar company Cronyism!
253141897361633280 Al Qaeda taking over Libya after we made it possible--really amazing.
253138753479122946 Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez said in a television interview that aired on Sunday If I were American, I'd vote for Obama.
253134031984664576 Big cancer risk from new environmental light bulbs--a big price to pay!
253126832319262720 Obama now wants to give another $450M to the Muslim Brotherhood. Money we don't have going to people that hate us. Moronic.
253123163838369793 How many more of our soldiers have to be shot by the Afghanis they are training? Let's get the hell out of there and focus on U.S.

252880994800115712 #TrumpTower is one of the country's top tourist destinations.
252874018955354114 Obama deserves much less credit for the killing of Bin Laden. The praise goes to our brave military and intelligence officers.
252855629654409216 Republicans and @MittRomney must get tough very soon.
252854124905897984 Only 36 days until the election. @MittRomney needs to stay on offense. Make Obama's terrible record the issue. #TimeToGetTough
252850650784882688 In debate, @MittRomney should ask Obama why autobiography states born in Kenya, raised in Indonesia.
252827853949923328 Cyberattack on White House--- what's next?
252779333003915264 Obama lied to the public about the Al Qaeda attack on our consulate in Libya. He should be held accountable.

251765821133684736 Sean's interview with Bob Woodward on @hannityshow was very interesting--Woodward was great.
251760809103990784 @IsraeliPM @netanyahu delivered an excellent speech yesterday at the UN. Too bad @AmbassadorRice wasn't there.
251758349060816896 @Mr_Schwab You have to love what you do and keep your focus at all times.
251752835904045056 Brits spent $57.8M on the royal family. Obamas cost us $1.4B in expenses--including entertainment Living large on us.
251750948836347906 It's amazing how different all of the polling results are--not an exact science.
251744361925201920 To be successful your focus has to be broad enough to think big at the same time. --'Midas Touch' with @theRealKiyosaki

251731068837834752 Obama is not working. US Manufacturing orders fell a record 13.9% in August. Where's the recovery?
251717030938570752 Watch this video for a look at our great course in Los Angeles--- Rancho Palos Verdes-- @TrumpGolfLA
251705588164210689 @LisaLampanelli You are terrific (always). Great job on the Apprentice.
251696944492195840 Be tenacious. Being tenacious means you're tough and patient at once, so it's a formidable combination.
251688377651441664 Keep the big picture in mind. There are always opportunities & possibilities, & thinking too small can negate a lot of them.
251685912130510848 Iraq was one of our biggest mistakes. We got absolutely nothing for our sacrifices.The country will collapse (cont)
251682520515633152 Having a vision for something can be a very powerful force for accomplishment.

251409907910336512 China's Financial Institutions are expanding overseas. They will own everything if we don't stop them now.
251406692045185024 ObamaCare is a failure. Costs are rising much faster under Obama than other Presidents.
251405719579009025 Now Obama's campaign is guaranteeing 12 million new jobs during a 2nd term More like $12T in new debt if he wins.
251393026369392640 A resort in Arizona is using sewage to make snow. Environmentalists are going crazy--I won't be skiing in that snow.

250975772083380226 Obama's complaints about Republicans stopping his agenda are BS since he had full control for two years. He can never take responsibility.
250971165642854401 Obama's new excuse for his failures is that you can't change Washington from the inside. Not what he said in '09.

250598028099063809 Living in denial--only 15% of Democrats think that recent economic news is poor
250597251800522752 Scary--Obama's budget deficits are so out of control that he has to borrow 40 cents on every dollar he spends.
250339592169979906 Today I spoke @LibertyU Convocation, a great crowd...
250332649430843392 With Obama and Bernanke destroying the value of the dollar, gold and real estate should continue to rise in value.
250328328693760000 The attack on our Libyan consulate was the worst attack on the US since 9/11. Time for Obama to come clean.

250321139119833088 All these polls released by news outlets are oversampling Democrats. They want to influence public perception of the race.
250317882213412865 The Emmys are all politics, that's why, despite nominations, The Apprentice never won--even though it should have many times over.
250313493197238272 Amazing Race winning an Emmy again is a total joke. The Emmys have no credibility--no wonder the ratings are at record lows.
250311855229255680 The Emmys were horrendous...the absolute worst show!
250289785309110272 With all of the bad economic numbers and horrendous foreign policy, Obama should be down by 12 points--and he's not.
250284170515972096 The Republican Party must spend its money wisely and do incredible television commercials. They must be tough and smart.
250283950067552256 Why did @MittRomney give his tax returns without demanding that Obama release his college records & applications in return?

246299459405893632 The media is pathetic. Our embassies are savaged by radicals while Obama does nothing and all they can do is criticize @MittRomney.
246295943752859648 What a coincidence that Obama's good friends in Libya and Egypt picked 9/11 to attack our embassies.
246295539992379392 With allies like Egypt and Libya, who needs enemies?!
246294689043578880 Shouldn't there have been increased security at our embassies on the anniversary of 9/11?

246253814880038913 If Obama was smart, he would cancel the Muslim Brotherhood's WH visit later this month. He won't.
246252875834089472 Romney's campaign is being put on the defensive. He cannot let this happen. Stop pandering. Must get tougher (cont)
246246932887007232 With the high prices of corn to continue expect even more inflation on the price of food.
246246297579958274 Obama's foreign policy is a complete and total disaster--the worst President we have ever had.
246235732287574016 We threw our ally Mubarak overboard and Egypt is now our enemy. Great going Obama--Israel is in trouble.
246235456482717696 This is all about American weakness and an incompetent President.
246232155670315009 Weakness, cow towing and not standing firm is provocative. We are getting pushed around and robbed under this President.
246229987181596672 The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary. -- Vince Lombardi
245985117271642112 Our $16T national debt is now bigger than our $15T GDP. If Obama is re-elected watch for an economic meltdown in 2013.
245980291775209474 Deja vu - I can remember a time when our embassies were stormed under another failed President. Obama=Carter.
245979296273928192 I guess Obama's Cairo Speech really worked out. The Muslim Brotherhood stormed our embassy on 9.11. Imagine if Obama speaks in Beijing?
245976292732846080 Those who refuse to draw red line to Iran don't have the moral right to put a red line to @Israel. -- @IsraeliPM @netanyahu
245972395532365824 No surprise. @DNC displayed Russian ships in tribute to vets Did they mean to honor the Russians?
245971629090426882 Obama will go down as the worst President in history on many topics but especially foreign policy.
245970051230998530 It's disgraceful that the Obama Administration's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic (cont)
245964708111331329 So Obama can host the Muslim Brotherhood Pres. Morsi in the White House but doesn't have time for @netanyahu?
245963239547097089 OPEC will use yesterday's attacks on our embassies to raise the price of gas. They are always ripping us off.
245962060964454400 It's Wednesday, how many more of our embassies will be stormed by Islamists?
245961358473048066 What did we get for fighting in Libya besides a dead Ambassador. Demand their oil.
245960182306336769 As bad as they were, I don't remember our embassies being attacked when Mubarak and Gaddafi were in power.
245956504191131649 The Middle East is blowing up--we didn't back Egypt and now they riot against us. Iran is using Iraqi airspace, (cont)
245955590147424256 Obama is a disaster at foreign policy. Never had the experience or knowledge. He is not capable of doing the job.
245955293786279936 Libya is selling its oil to China--I notice the Chinese Ambassador is very safe.
245954982300495872 I always said the people we fought for in Libya were bad news. Once again, I was right.
245941417355116544 Obama doesn't know what he's doing. His foreign policy is a disaster. Libya, Egypt, Iraq, Afghanistan--all (cont)
245905556018188289 An attack on our Embassy is an attack on our soil. We have been attacked by Libya. Go into Libya & take the (cont)
245902265922224128 We fight to free Libya and they kill our Ambassador and other Americans. Obama's foreign policy is a joke.
245885754939691009 When will Obama next go on vacation if he wins the election? The day after.
245867127804932096 Why is the Pentagon wasting precious dollars on going 'green.' Complete waste. We need the best & easiest fuel for our military.
245615721411915776 I hope the @GOP realizes that if they blow this election the Tea Party won't be with them next time.
245612360818122752 There is no instance of a nation benefitting from prolonged warfare. -- Sun Tzu
245609197100728322 If Obama wins it is the end of the Republican party. -- @limbaugh
245608803205267456 Amazing. @CelebApprentice has started filming our record 13th season this week thanks to our big and very loyal fan base.
245604958618148864 Priorities--while fundraising and campaigning on our dime, Obama has skipped over 50% of his intel briefings
245604297029595136 China is an international pariah. They are now harassing Japan over its purchase of 3 uninhabited islands
245599709178257408 Why won't Obama release his college applications? Is there something 'foreign' about them?
245592603716907009 84% of US troops wounded & 70% of our brave men & women killed in Afghanistan have all come under Obama. Time to get out of there.
245587595017478144 Whatever happened to Obama's 'independent investigation' into national security leaks from his administration? Where's the media?
245587044523462656 The onus of the Chicago teachers' strike falls squarely on the teachers & their union. Inexcusable to leave children without school.
245578692061954048 On this solemn day of remembrance we can all take joy in the fact that Bin Laden's last sight was a Navy SEAL pulling the trigger.

245572110867628032 My @SquawkCNBC #TrumpTuesday interview with Ken Langone & Dick Grasso discussing the Chicago teachers' strike @ 2012
245549652349440001 Discussing the 9/11 attack and coverage with @kingsthings while hosting the 25th anniversary of his @CNN show
245546743285030912 An impromptu interview I did with German TV on 9/11 down by Ground Zero discussing the attack and WTC Towers
245546164957622272 Today we remember and honor our fellow Americans and NYPD and FDNY who fell 11 years ago.
245544267739705346 Obama called August's job report progress. Overall, 96K new jobs & over 173K new people on food stamps
245518281639862273 You need to overcome the tug of people against you as you reach for high goals. --General George S. Patton
245517710811860992 Why has Barack Obama repeatedly told inconsistent stories about his religious background? Who is he?
245513534350446592 Barack Obama used to mock Bush's 300K monthly job reports Now Obama wishes he could have a month half as good.
245262384304910336 President Obama is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people
245254955827597313 Obama asked a 7 yr old for his birth certificate. He's in your face because the Republicans dropped the ball. (cont)
244164673031790593 In today's #trumpvlog I speak about Clint Eastwood, the #DNC, and Drew Peterson-
244163754168827905 You have enemies? Good. That means you've stood up for something, sometime in your life. -- Winston Churchill
244156538393088003 I'll be on @foxandfriends on Monday at 7:30 AM. Tune in!
244154026428612608 One of the best moves I ever made was staying out of last decade's artificial real estate boom. But I used the downturn to my advantage.
244139232292139008 During @BarackObama's presidency, median family income has fallen 4.8% Terrible for the middle class.
244131526143528961 A lot of people strongly advised me against doing @ApprenticeNBC. Next week we start filming the record 13th season Hence, go with your gut!
244123358638247937 If @BarackObama had to use the same labor participation he had when he entered office then the unemployment number would be 11.2%
244120098196041728 This chart from AEI's @JimPethokoukis shows how terrible @BarackObama's 'recovery' really is: Disaster.
244102395838230528 Unemployment rate only dropped because more people are out of labor force & have stopped looking for work.Not a real recovery, phony numbers
244099932359897088 There are now 119,000 fewer Americans employed than there were in July. The economy is still terrible.
244095178481221632 Today's job report is dismal. Now a record 88,921,000 Americans are no longer in the work force.
244093700559499264 Drew Peterson, a real sleaze, just convicted of killing wife. Change the law so he gets death penalty.
244087721604292608 Dems had a very good and professional convention. The Republicans must be smart and tough--and fast!
244084676237615104 The Republicans must get Virgil Goode out of the race in Virginia. He will take votes away from @MittRomney.
243810078552096768 The YouTube of the 2012 Miss USA contestants, @GiulianaRancic and me singing Call Me Maybe has over 2M views.
243805888148811776 Under @BarackObama, 1 out of every 7 Americans is on food stamps.
243801985374101504 Scary--while @BarackObama has been POTUS for 1.6% of America's history, he has amassed 33.3% of the total debt.
243799216886001665 We've gone from $10 trillion that the president inherited from all prior presidents to $16 trillion -- @MittRomney
243794744780681217 Forty-seven million now on food stamps. When he came to office there were 32 million. He's added 15 million people. --@MittRomney
243792507358556160 The Chinese are mistreating Hillary Clinton on her trip They have zero respect for us. Outrageous!
243783684669440000 Remember while @BarackObama is lauding himself tonight with self-indulgent compliments we have our brave soldiers fighting in Afghanistan.
243773528682397697 After @BarackObama's speech tonight--which should be well delivered--reality will hit Friday morning when the new jobs report is released.
243770523883016192 The delegates at the @DNC convention keep shouting Four More Years. Four more years of 18% real unemployment and another $6T in debt?
243761893049769985 Now we will never know if @BarackObama would have been able to fill Bank of America Stadium. Pretty convenient.
243752456763363328 @BarackObama is now taking credit for changing party platform language but he reviewed it prior to the convention
243749201656291328 Donald Trump Has Given Millions To Pro-Romney SuperPACs and His Whole Family Is Cutting Checks to Mitt's Campaign
243737266944630785 Iran is flying supply planes to Syria through Iraqi airspace. Thank you, United States, for making this possible!
243708062358183936 Bill Clinton did a great job last night--the Democrats are lucky to have him. Do you really believe he likes @BarackObama?
243444064995921920 Once again under@BarackObama, the US has fallen down the ranks of global competitiveness We must do better.
243438036761866240 Other networks are begging me to do a show--I can't because I'm doing the Apprentice!
243433630976847872 Change before you have to. --Jack Welch
243428620792647680 Scary thought--is the sexual pervert Anthony Weiner now in Charlotte? Did he bring his phone with him?
243427708778971136 The Democrats dropped all references to God from their platform. Not good!
243424423628128256 Have you seen the new #TRUMP line of clothing, apparel and fragrances @Macy's? Selling like hotcakes. Great for Christmas gifts, etc.
243420340716466177 Better off? The $16T US debt works out to $136,260 per household, a 50% increase since @BarackObama took office.
243414873927729153 North Carolina is a fantastic state with wonderful people. I enjoy my time there when I visit Trump National Charlotte.
243414279821336577 I wish the 23 million who are unemployed were able to celebrate like the Democrats in Charlotte right now.
243407914017120256 Almost every T.V. show is asking me to go on--especially the @Late_Show. It's simple--I get the ratings!
243403096745705472 @serenawilliams is a special player. After winning the Gold for the US in the Olympics, it looks like she will (cont)
243402256995729410 With all the talk of fiscal responsibility at the @DNC convention yesterday, it was ironic that the debt passed $16T.
243370024696430594 @lancearmstrong, revise your decision to quit--go back and fight.
243369048040144896 Why does US doping agency destroy an American icon, @lancearmstrong, for events that took place years ago in France?
243368856490479616 @lancearmstrong teammate is angry and jealous--he is no Lance.
243365239196876801 Very good speech by @MichelleObama--and under great pressure--Dems should be proud!
243358288106897408 No surprise. @BarackObama is letting the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt default on their US loans Big mistake!
243354343724687361 July U.S. construction had biggest drop in 12months. Bad indicator on economic numbers for rest of the year.
243353107382300673 What message does it send when @BarackObama's campaign has to spin whether America is better off than it was 4 years ago?
243341953138323457 OPEC is better off than they were 4 years ago. Gas has more than doubled during @BarackObama's term. Outrageous!
243340648432943104 The Chinese are better off than they were 4 years ago. They have stolen even more from us in jobs & trade during @BarackObama's term.
243081953509773312 NBC Wall St Journal Poll of African American voters: 94% @BarackObama, 0% @MittRomney.Even worse than Hillary's old numbers. Is that racism?
243079812372127744 With our national debt passing $16T during the @DNC convention, @BarackObama has amassed more debt than the first 42 presidents. Scary.
243075127296798720 Record setting gas prices in the U.S. -- we're really looking dumb. Lots of $'s being made on us.
243073912810917888 The media can track down @PaulRyan's old girlfriend and marathon time but can't find @BarackObama's college applications or other info.
243073186873372672 Smart move by @BarackObama having Pres. Bill Clinton deliver the @DNC convention keynote.
243061925209047040 Is this Hope & Change? A record 46.7M Americans were on food stamps this past June. We must do better.
243061460450816000 Why does @BarackObama have such a fascination with my plane? He is more than welcomed to come for a ride.
243051905255886848 Joe Paterno's family should sue the idiots @PennState that made that ridiculous deal--and commissioned the one sided report.
242973742836375552 Be yardstick of quality. Some people aren't used to an environment where excellence is expected. -- Steve Jobs
242386227913953280 As I predicted 1 year ago, gasoline prices hit a record high today...OPEC is having a ball at our expense.
242385540589182976 Great going Andy Roddick! Another victory for a fabulous player. Brooklyn Decker is good luck.
242341271698538496 I win awards for speaking-but the enemies either won't comment or will say only bad...leave Clint alone!
242340859201323008 If you have a speech-one that would put Winston Churchill to shame, liberals would find a way to make it sound terrible!
241967336599470080 @MELANIATRUMP on @QVC tonight with her fabulous Melania Timepieces & Jewelry. Tune in at 1AM EST!
241885499562815489 Republicans are always saying Obama is such a nice guy. When will they learn that he is not?
241722826334289920 Andy Roddick...a great tennis player is a fantastic guy with a wonderful wife.
241665757098934272 Republicans should have been much tougher on Obama. Just wait until you see what Obama does to Romney at the DNC!
241599708554997761 China is now deploying drones across ocean routes used for trade They stole the technology from us.
241591228263702528 @BarackObama's assault on coal and gas and oil will send energy and manufacturing jobs to China. --@MittRomney
241586130183667712 I am sure the Chinese are getting anxious. They watch the polls. @MittRomney won't let them cheat us anymore.
241584383235088384 We have all the cards. Now is the time to make a great deal with Iran.
241582844504317952 @GovMikeHuckabee was great the other night. People love him.
241581489123373056 Obama's ideas don't move us 'Forward,' they take us 'Backwards.' These are ideas people come to America to get away from. --@marcorubio
241574322995605504 @MittRomney's entire life and career have built prosperity and growth.
241573094291034112 I loved watching Clint Eastwood last night--he was terrific!
241541471138877440 If you accept the expectations of others, especially negative ones, then you will never change the outcome. -- Michael Jordan
241525038220722176 Gas prices are about to hit a record high during the Labor Day weekend. @BarackObama could have stopped this.
241519729309794305 It's Friday, how many advertisers dropped @HuffPost today?
241266899198033920 A fact--golfers don't get aches & pains like others who don't golf. It is amazingly remedial.
241265547319336960 Of course @hardball_chris attacked 'birthers' in praising @CondoleezzaRice's speech. Chris has completely lost it.
241257104592220161 Letterman @Late_Show begging me to go back on his low rated show--calls lots--must apologize for racist comment.
241250046081900545 Too busy playing golf? @BarackObama sends form letters with an electronic signature to the parents of fallen SEALs
241246369631854592 I am impressed with how clearly @PaulRyanVP explains the challenges we face and the solutions @MittRomney will bring as President.
241241309095022592 Book on Bin Laden is a terrible violation of code--makes @BarackObama's story a big lie.
241235355012046848 I wonder what @JoeBiden was thinking last night as @PaulRyanVP delivered that knockout speech. Joe should call in sick for the VP debate.
241229495548387329 After four years of getting the run-around, America needs a turnaround, and the man for the job is Governor Mitt Romney. @PaulRyanVP
241227269702549506 The dummies left Iraq (and Libya) without the oil!
241222982419230720 Let me say it as clearly as possible, that the attack on my Catholic brothers and sisters is an attack on me. -- @GovMike Huckabee
241222411096297472 Congratulations to @GovMikeHuckabee on last night's tremendous speech. Mike united the party faithful and explained that we can do better.
241177001438892032 Only two weeks until we start shooting @CelebApprentice. We really have something amazing for the fans this year.
241173519851978753 Gas prices are way too high. With an economy contracting and lower demand, how do OPEC & the speculators get away with this?!
241167622811557888 Even the SEALS who killed Bin Laden don't like @JoeBiden
241159091005820929 It's Thursday and again I ask--how much money is China stealing from us?
241158082376388608 I was putting together my early deals in New York & I was advised by many that I was too young. Believe in yourself & you can do anything.
240896478233645057 China's media is attacking @MittRomney while endorsing @BarackObama Of course. Mitt knows it's Time To Get Tough.
240886993259745280 I am astonished that the media continues to lie. @BarackObama gutted welfare reform. It is a fact!
240873922332078081 America needs @MittRomney and @PaulRyanVP and we need them right now. -- @GovChristie
240871135955279872 No one will work harder. No one will move heaven and earth like Mitt Romney to make this country a better place to live! -- @AnnDRomney
240868182229929985 New business start-ups at the lowest level in 30 years and the EPA is now the Employment Prevention Agency. -- @bobmcdonnell
240860733926154240 It's Wednesday, how much money is China stealing from us today?
240858162872328193 Great speech by my good friend @GovChristie. He did something you won't hear at @BarackObama's convention---tell the truth.
240856415764357120 My @SquawkCNBC #TrumpTuesday interview discussing the 2012 election, OPEC ripping us off & @MittRomney's job policy
240846139409190913 Congratulations to @AnnDRomney on delivering a knock out speech last night. America can't wait to call her our First Lady.
240845487794696192 An excerpt of my @TheBrodyFile interview at the Sarasota 'Statesman of the Year' dinner discussing the Tea Party
240816432982679552 China must be worried that @MittRomney will win this November. They have never had such a pushover like @BarackObama.
240811658786783232 What a coincidence--Michelle Obama called Kenya @BarackObama's homeland in 2008
240797696120741890 @BarackObama's dismal job record is reason alone that he must be defeated this November.
240551191484960769 I am very worried that if @BarackObama is re-elected then Medicare will be destroyed. We must take care of our seniors.
240547932607238145 I can't wait to read this...RT @Newsmax_Media: SEAL Book Explodes, Obama Furious
240538327948857344 @BarackObama's Super PAC has continually called @MittRomney a murderer Ironic since Obama is destroying Medicare.
240537041161580544 I stand ready to lead us down a new path, where we are lifted up by our desire to succeed, not by a resentment of success. -- @MittRomney
240531444345229313 It's Tuesday--how much inflation has @BarackObama's spending caused today on the price of food and gas?
240529084940169216 @GovChristie is going to do a fantastic job tonight explaining why @MittRomney should be elected and @BarackObama has to go.
240526021244383232 @MELANIATRUMP and I are looking forward to watching @AnnDRomney's speech tonight. She is an amazing woman who will be a great First Lady!
240525195243307008 Happy to hear that @ralphreed's Faith and Freedom chapters are at the @RNC convention supporting @MittRomney. We must be united to win!
240521733520637952 Remember when @ariannahuff ran for Governor of California. She got 3 votes.

240517969841643520 Ask China if their rapidly expanding (with our money) Navy or Armed Forces are going green -- They would laugh in your face!

240507883928813568 My @FoxNews @TeamCavuto interview discussing the @RNC Convention, businesses making products in China and unemployment
240479559722627072 The Bay Bridge in San Francisco is being built by the Chinese--tremendous cost overruns. A total mess. We should build our own bridges, etc
240476818224857089 Don't think my statement on @ariannahuff was harsh, if you knew her and the phony Huffington Post you would understand--- more to follow.
240462265680289792 @ariannahuff is unattractive both inside and out. I fully understand why her former husband left her for a man- he made a good decision.
240455676600659968 @FinancialTimes writes that @BarackObama should pray that China overtakes US Don't worry, he is making it happen.

233931230930944000 As we told the @nydailynews, I was asked to speak at the RNC but said no, because I will be doing something much bigger--just watch!
233930793154650113 The failing New York Daily News knowingly incorrectly reported that I wanted to speak at the Republican National Convention--wrong!
233924399680589824 China is cooking up conspiracy theories that the Olympics are rigged. They don't understand why they can't cheat.

233633866399764480 Even more @BarackObama crony capitalism & corruption. We are guaranteeing a $105M loan to another Obama donor

233285076669050880 Pathetic--@BarackObama is 'sweetening' his offer to the Taliban Read 'The Art of The Deal.'

233213932985253889 People are finally beginning to hit China and OPEC. They never give me credit for being the first--by far--but that's okay!
233200677311107072 Looking forward to meeting the great folks of Sarasota GOP party when I am honored as 'Statesman of the Year.' Should be a wonderful time.
233191196854456320 Glad that @MittRomney is hitting @BarackObama on ending work requirements for welfare. Obama attacks the American work ethic.

232925812276465664 I am honored that @BarackObama has featured my plane in one of his attack ads. It was made in America!
232923697009278976 A 'confidential source' has called my office and told me that @BarackObama has added over $6T to the new national debt & ruined US credit.
232917872215724032 Glad to hear that @FLGovScott will be speaking at the @RNC Convention. He is a true conservative and fantastic governor!
232913961656401921 To the geniuses at 'Americans United for Change': the more you tax me the less people I employ. Get it?
232913045637189632 Now the world is looking to China for an economic 'lift' @BarackObama has ruined our economic hegemony.
232909540725780480 I have founded and run one of the largest real estate empires in the world. I employ thousands of people. Why am I the enemy?
232901153287991296 The @whitehouse has 'clarified' that the unemployment is actually 8.254% not 8.3% A little sensitive are we?
232900144599801856 The real outsourcer - @BarackObama is funding German automakers with the GM bailout money How does that help us?

232876916355497986 My @SquawkCNBC interview discussing the @GOP convention, @BarackObama's sealed records & @SenatorReid's tax claim
232869745546907648 The real war on women--over 175,000 fewer held jobs in July & 94,000 dropped out of labor force We must do better.
232852685014061056 Congratulations to @BarackObama--yesterday marked the 1 YR anniversary of our country's credit being downgraded
232848729659555840 The Senate should be more concerned about actually passing a budget than spreading lies about @MittRomney's taxes.
232839851945390080 The Fed should not do another 'stimulus.' We can't keep spending our children's future away on waste.
232832720441602048 Convenient - David Plouffe collected $100G fee from Iranian affiliate only a month before joining @whitehouse
232830924675481600 Wrong--@BarackObama's '08 campaign manager & current Senior WH Advisor collected $100G fee from Iranian affiliate
232578895713546240 @MittRomney will create 2 million new jobs if elected POTUS. If reelected, @BarackObama will create over $12T in new debt. Easy choice.

231092414985687040 Capital isn't scarce; vision is.
231080056590594048 So generous and pious! After spending millions of our tax dollars on his campaign through travel, @BarackObama donated to himself.

231057112099323904 The U.S. manufacturing sector has suffered its greatest order losses under @BarackObama. He has stood idle while China steals our jobs.

230292340827385856 Reckless--@BarackObama is projecting $1.2T deficit from 2012 budget & a projected $25.4T debt in a decade
230285609250484224 Not only does ObamaCare have at least 21 new taxes but it will lead to a tremendous doctor shortfall.
230042185544892416 The Chinese are illegally dumping bird-killing wind turbines on our shores. Only one of many grievances--we should act.
230039125745614848 The US GDP in 2010 was 4.1%, down to 2% in 2011 & now 1.5%. I guess @BarackObama's plan is not working!
230034109781667840 @BarackObama should be careful questioning @MittRomney on diplomacy--how many times has Obama apologized for our country on foreign soil?!
230033235407671297 @BarackObama bowed to the Saudi King in public--yet the Dems are questioning @MittRomney's diplomatic skills.
230026401259081728 The difference between @MittRomney and @BarackObama's campaign promises to @Israel is that Mitt will actually keep all of his.
230015217873076224 Smart move by the Democrats to have Pres. @billclinton play a key role in their convention.
229924907784482816 There is no substitute for hard work.

228937215739318272 I am confident when American public gets to know @MittRomney, the race will go his way. He's honorable & successful man--polls looking good.
228931360843251714 Price of corn has jumped over 50%. This will cause a jump in food prices perhaps beyond what we've ever seen. Nasty for the economy.
228501680470257664 The Audacity of @BarackObama--the Federal Reserve purchased 61% of all debt issued by Treasury in 2011. Killing our children's future.
228487681477324800 The Federal government has $2.7T in assets & $17.5T in total liabilities plus another $4.7T in intergovernmental debt. Have a nice day.

228225086098927617 Hope & Change--since @BarackObama has taken office, the US debt has increased by an average of $64K per taxpayer.
228221920963862531 US Gov't is on the hook for more than a third of the world's entire debt & we wonder why China & OPEC are laughing all the way to the bank!

215533486830919680 CORRUPT--with the national security leaks and Fast & Furious, there are clearly at least two cover ups in @BarackObama's White House.

138706696636858369 When the Super Committee fails, @BarackObama will get exactly what he really wants--automatic cuts in defense spending. This is his plan.
138653976416632832 If @BarackObama wanted the Super Committee to succeed, he would have lead. Instead he has been campaigning. Where is the leadership?

137640805908234240 ObamaCare is one of the greatest threats our country faces. It is unsustainable and will lead America into complete insolvency.
137629814998835200 Why is @BarackObama delaying the sale of F-16 aircraft to Taiwan? Wrong message to send to China. #TimeToGetTough
137599605704626176 Washington is simply incapable of any moderation because @BarackObama is such an extreme leftist. He must be defeated. #TImeToGetTough.
137559273394802690 Made in America? @BarackObama called his 'birthplace' Hawaii here in Asia.
137545085406552064 Regardless of the USC's ruling, ObamaCare can only be defeated politically. It must be legislatively repealed or America will go bankrupt.
